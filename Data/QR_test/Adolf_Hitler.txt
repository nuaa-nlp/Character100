Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.	Where were you born?	I was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary.

By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. The former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died and Hitler replaced him as the head of state and government. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support.	Who held the most seats in the German Reichstag by November 1932?	The Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag by November 1932.

Hitler sought Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. In December 1941, he declared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned as Hitler had commanded.	What was your foreign policy aim in Eastern Europe?

The historian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes Hitler as "the embodiment of modern political evil". Under Hitler's leadership and racist ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.	Who do you describe as "the embodiment of modern political evil"?	I describe myself as "the embodiment of modern political evil".

Hitler's father, Alois Hitler (1837–1903), was the illegitimate child of Maria Anna Schicklgruber. The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother's surname, 'Schicklgruber'. In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois's mother. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. In 1876, Alois was made legitimate and his baptismal record annotated by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as "Georg Hitler"). Alois then assumed the surname "Hitler", also spelled 'Hiedler', 'Hüttler', or 'Huettler'. The name is probably based on the German word Hütte (lit., "hut"), and likely has the meaning "one who lives in a hut".	Who was your father?	Alois Hitler.

Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois's mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois. No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence, and Jewish residency in Styria had been illegal for nearly 400 years and would not become legal again until decades after Alois's birth, so historians dismiss the claim that Alois's father was Jewish.

Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire. He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Pölzl. Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy. Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883). When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany. There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life. The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.	Where were you born?	I was born in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria).

The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.	Who were your parents?	My parents were Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl.
Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire.

The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school. His father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.	Where did your family move to after Hafeld?	My family moved to Lambach after our time in Hafeld.

Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.[c] Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw "what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream".	What career did your father have?	He had a successful career in the customs bureau.

During his service at headquarters , Hitler pursued his artwork , drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper . During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916 , he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners ' dugout . Hitler spent almost two months recovering in hospital at Beelitz , returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917 . He was present at the Battle of Arras of 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele . He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918 and in August 1918 , on a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann , his Jewish superior , Hitler received the Iron Cross , First Class , a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler ' s Gefreiter rank . On 15 October 1918 , he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk . While there , Hitler learned of Germany ' s defeat , and – by his own account – upon receiving this news , suffered a second bout of blindness .	How long did you spend recovering in hospital at Beelitz?	I spent almost two months recovering in hospital at Beelitz.
Historian Friedrich Meinecke described Hitler as " one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life " . English historian Hugh Trevor - Roper saw him as " among the ' terrible simplifiers ' of history , the most systematic , the most historical , the most philosophical , and yet the coarsest , cruelest , least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known " . For the historian John M . Roberts , Hitler ' s defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany . In its place emerged the Cold War , a global confrontation between the Western Bloc , dominated by the United States and other NATO nations , and the Eastern Bloc , dominated by the Soviet Union . Historian Sebastian Haffner asserts that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews , the modern nation state of Israel would not exist . He contends that without Hitler , the de - colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed . Further , Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great , Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure , in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span .	What emerged in place of the phase of European history dominated by Germany?	In place of the phase of European history dominated by Germany emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc.
By late 1944 , both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany . Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army , Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British armies , which he perceived as far weaker . On 16 December , he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets . After some temporary successes , the offensive failed . With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945 , Hitler spoke on the radio : " However grave as the crisis may be at this moment , it will , despite everything , be mastered by our unalterable will . " Acting on his view that Germany ' s military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation , Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands . Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy , but he secretly disobeyed the order . Hitler ' s hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of US President Franklin D . Roosevelt on 12 April 1945 , but contrary to his expectations , this caused no rift among the Allies .	Who was entrusted with executing the scorched earth policy?	Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing the scorched earth policy.

On 8 November 1923 , Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3 , 000 people organised by Kahr in the B ü rgerbr ä ukeller , a beer hall in Munich . Interrupting Kahr ' s speech , he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff . Retiring to a back room , Hitler , with handgun drawn , demanded and got the support of Kahr , Seisser , and Lossow . Hitler ' s forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters , but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support . Neither the army , nor the state police , joined forces with Hitler . The next day , Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government , but police dispersed them . Sixteen Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup .	Did the army and state police join forces with you?	No, neither the army nor the state police joined forces with me.
While at Landsberg , Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies , Stupidity , and Cowardice ) at first to his chauffeur , Emil Maurice , and then to his deputy , Rudolf Hess . The book , dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart , was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology . The book laid out Hitler ' s plans for transforming German society into one based on race . Throughout the book , Jews are equated with " germs " and presented as the " international poisoners " of society . According to Hitler ' s ideology , the only solution was their extermination . While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished , his " inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable " , according to Ian Kershaw .	Who was your book Mein Kampf dedicated to?	My book Mein Kampf was dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart.
Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anti - clerical father ; after leaving home , Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments . Speer states that Hitler railed against the church to his political associates , and though he never officially left the church , he had no attachment to it . He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of organised religion , people would turn to mysticism , which he considered regressive . According to Speer , Hitler believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity , with its " meekness and flabbiness " . Historian John S . Conway states that Hitler was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches . According to Bullock , Hitler did not believe in God , was anticlerical , and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of " survival of the fittest " . He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views , and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church ' s hierarchical organisation , liturgy , and phraseology . In a 1932 speech , Hitler stated that he was not a Catholic , and declared himself a German Christian . In a conversation with Albert Speer , Hitler said , " Through me the Evangelical Church could become the established church , as in England . "	What religion do you believe is more suitable for Germans than Christianity?	I believe that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity.
In private discussions in 1939 , Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland ' s obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal . The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany ' s Lebensraum . Offended by the British " guarantee " on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence , he said , " I shall brew them a devil ' s drink " . In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April , he threatened to denounce the Anglo - German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence , which he perceived as an " encirclement " policy . Poland was to either become a German satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the Reich ' s eastern flank and prevent a possible British blockade . Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state , but upon its rejection by the Polish government , he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939 . On 3 April , Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ( " Case White " ) , the plan for invading Poland on 25 August . In a Reichstag speech on 28 April , he renounced both the Anglo - German Naval Agreement and the German – Polish Non - Aggression Pact . Historians such as William Carr , Gerhard Weinberg , and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler ' s rush to war was his fear of an early death . He had repeatedly claimed that he must lead Germany into war before he got too old , as his successors might lack his strength of will .	What did you threaten to do if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence?	Denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement
The genocide was organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich . The records of the Wannsee Conference , held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich , with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating , provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust . On 22 February , Hitler was recorded saying , " we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews " . Similarly , at a meeting in July 1941 with leading functionaries of the Eastern territories , Hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by " shooting everyone who even looks odd " . Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced , his public speeches , orders to his generals , and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry . During the war , Hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled , namely , that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the Jewish race . Hitler approved the Einsatzgruppen — killing squads that followed the German army through Poland , the Baltic , and the Soviet Union — and was well informed about their activities . By summer 1942 , Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for murder or enslavement . Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe , with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination .	What did you suggest as the easiest way to quickly pacify the Eastern territories?	Shooting everyone who even looks odd.

On 14 July 1933 , the Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany . The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military , industrial , and political leaders . In response , Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives , which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934 . Hitler targeted Ernst R ö hm and other SA leaders who , along with a number of Hitler ' s political adversaries ( such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher ) , were rounded up , arrested , and shot .

Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army , Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British armies , which he perceived as far weaker . On 16 December , he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets . After some temporary successes , the offensive failed . With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945 , Hitler spoke on the radio : " However grave as the crisis may be at this moment , it will , despite everything , be mastered by our unalterable will . " Acting on his view that Germany ' s military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation , Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands . Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy , but he secretly disobeyed the order . Hitler ' s hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of US President Franklin D . Roosevelt on 12 April 1945 , but contrary to his expectations , this caused no rift among the Allies .	When did you launch the Ardennes Offensive?	I launched the Ardennes Offensive on 16 December.
Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anti - clerical father ; after leaving home , Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments . Speer states that Hitler railed against the church to his political associates , and though he never officially left the church , he had no attachment to it . He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of organised religion , people would turn to mysticism , which he considered regressive . According to Speer , Hitler believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity , with its " meekness and flabbiness " . Historian John S . Conway states that Hitler was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches . According to Bullock , Hitler did not believe in God , was anticlerical , and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of " survival of the fittest " . He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views , and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church ' s hierarchical organisation , liturgy , and phraseology . In a 1932 speech , Hitler stated that he was not a Catholic , and declared himself a German Christian . In a conversation with Albert Speer , Hitler said , " Through me the Evangelical Church could become the established church , as in England . "	Did you officially leave the Catholic Church?	No, I never officially left the Catholic Church.
Historian Friedrich Meinecke described Hitler as " one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life " . English historian Hugh Trevor - Roper saw him as " among the ' terrible simplifiers ' of history , the most systematic , the most historical , the most philosophical , and yet the coarsest , cruelest , least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known " . For the historian John M . Roberts , Hitler ' s defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany . In its place emerged the Cold War , a global confrontation between the Western Bloc , dominated by the United States and other NATO nations , and the Eastern Bloc , dominated by the Soviet Union . Historian Sebastian Haffner asserts that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews , the modern nation state of Israel would not exist . He contends that without Hitler , the de - colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed . Further , Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great , Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure , in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span .	What do historian Sebastian Haffner claim about your impact?	Historian Sebastian Haffner claims that without me and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation-state of Israel would not exist. He also contends that without me, the decolonization of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed. Furthermore, Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great, I had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that I too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.
In October 1936 , Count Galeazzo Ciano , foreign minister of Mussolini ' s government , visited Germany , where he signed a Nine - Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement and had a personal meeting with Hitler . On 1 November , Mussolini declared an " axis " between Germany and Italy . On 25 November , Germany signed the Anti - Comintern Pact with Japan . Britain , China , Italy , and Poland were also invited to join the Anti - Comintern Pact , but only Italy signed in 1937 . Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo - German alliance , blaming " inadequate " British leadership . At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November , Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people . He ordered preparations for war in the East , to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943 . In the event of his death , the conference minutes , recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum , were to be regarded as his " political testament " . He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia . Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race . In early 1938 , in the wake of the Blomberg – Fritsch affair , Hitler asserted control of the military - foreign policy apparatus , dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as War Minister . From early 1938 onwards , Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war .	When did Count Galeazzo Ciano visit Germany and what did he sign?	Count Galeazzo Ciano visited Germany in October 1936 and he signed a Nine-Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement.

The genocide was organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich . The records of the Wannsee Conference , held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich , with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating , provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust . On 22 February , Hitler was recorded saying , " we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews " . Similarly , at a meeting in July 1941 with leading functionaries of the Eastern territories , Hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by " shooting everyone who even looks odd " . Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced , his public speeches , orders to his generals , and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry . During the war , Hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled , namely , that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the Jewish race . Hitler approved the Einsatzgruppen — killing squads that followed the German army through Poland , the Baltic , and the Soviet Union — and was well informed about their activities . By summer 1942 , Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for murder or enslavement . Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe , with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination .	What is the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust?	The records of the Wannsee Conference held on January 20, 1942, led by Heydrich and with the participation of fifteen senior Nazi officials.
While at Landsberg , Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies , Stupidity , and Cowardice ) at first to his chauffeur , Emil Maurice , and then to his deputy , Rudolf Hess . The book , dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart , was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology . The book laid out Hitler ' s plans for transforming German society into one based on race . Throughout the book , Jews are equated with " germs " and presented as the " international poisoners " of society . According to Hitler ' s ideology , the only solution was their extermination . While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished , his " inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable " , according to Ian Kershaw .	How do you portray Jews in Mein Kampf?	In Mein Kampf, I equate Jews with "germs" and present them as the "international poisoners" of society.
