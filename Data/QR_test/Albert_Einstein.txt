Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.	When were you born?	I was born on March 14, 1879.

In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass–energy equivalence. He thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.	What were the four groundbreaking papers that you published in 1905?	The four groundbreaking papers that I published in 1905 were on the theory of the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass–energy equivalence.

However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that "God does not play dice". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.	What were the two unsuccessful endeavors that you worked on?	I worked on opposing the evolution of quantum mechanics and attempting to devise a unified field theory.

In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. In Pavia, the Einsteins settled in Palazzo Cornazzani, a medieval building where, at different times, Ugo Foscolo, Contardo Ferrini and Ada Negri lived. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note. During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field".	When did your father's company lose the bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting?	In 1894.

Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem aged 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that only a short time after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow." His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".	At what age did you teach yourself algebra and Euclidean geometry?	I taught myself algebra and Euclidean geometry at the age of 12.

Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".	What was the original proof that you discovered?	The original proof that I discovered was the Pythagorean theorem.
Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem aged 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that only a short time after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, "[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics ... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow."

In 1911 , Einstein used his 1907 equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the Sun ' s gravity . In 1913 , Einstein improved upon those calculations by using the curvature of spacetime to represent the gravity field . By the fall of 1915 , Einstein had successfully completed his general theory of relativity , which he used to calculate that deflection , and the perihelion precession of Mercury . In 1919 , that deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 . Those observations were published in the international media , making Einstein world - famous . On 7 November 1919 , the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read : " Revolution in Science   – New Theory of the Universe   – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown " .	What did you use your equivalence principle to calculate in 1911?	I used my equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the Sun's gravity.

Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews . He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza ' s philosophy . He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings , a view which he described as na ï ve . He clarified , however , that " I am not an atheist " , preferring to call himself an agnostic , or a " deeply religious nonbeliever " . When asked if he believed in an afterlife , Einstein replied , " No . And one life is enough for me . "	What did you say about your spiritual outlook?	I spoke of my spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews.
This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin , both noted for their pacifism . Carl Laemmle , head of Universal Studios , gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin . They had an instant rapport , with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife , Elsa , to his home for dinner . Chaplin said Einstein ' s outward persona , calm and gentle , seemed to conceal a " highly emotional temperament " , from which came his " extraordinary intellectual energy " .	How did Chaplin describe your outward persona?	Chaplin described my outward persona as calm and gentle.
In 1918 , Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party , a liberal party . Later in his life , Einstein ' s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism , which he detailed in his essays such as " Why Socialism ? " His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time . In 1925 , he criticized them for not having a ' well - regulated system of government ' and called their rule a ' regime of terror and a tragedy in human history ' . He later adopted a more moderated view , criticizing their methods but praising them , which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin : " In Lenin I honor a man , who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice . I do not find his methods advisable . One thing is certain , however : men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind ' s conscience . " Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics . He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation - states in the framework of a world federation . He wrote " I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself . " The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932 , and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1 , 427 pages long .	What did you strongly advocate for in terms of global governance?	I strongly advocated for the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.
In 1895 , at the age of 16 , Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z ü rich ( later the Eidgen ö ssische Technische Hochschule , ETH ) . He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination , but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics . On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school , he attended the Argovian cantonal school ( gymnasium ) in Aarau , Switzerland , in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling . While lodging with the family of Jost Winteler , he fell in love with Winteler ' s daughter , Marie . Einstein ' s sister Maja later married Winteler ' s son Paul . In January 1896 , with his father ' s approval , Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of W ü rttemberg to avoid military service . In September 1896 , he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades , including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects , on a scale of 1 – 6 . At 17 , he enrolled in the four - year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school . Marie Winteler , who was a year older , moved to Olsberg , Switzerland , for a teaching post .	What subjects did you obtain exceptional grades in?	Physics and mathematics.

A more famous version of this argument came in 1935 , when Einstein published a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox . In this thought experiment , two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled . Then , no matter how far the two particles were separated , a precise position measurement on one particle would imply the ability to predict , perfectly , the result of measuring the position of the other particle . Likewise , a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other particle , without needing to disturb the other particle in any way . They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other , since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light , which is forbidden by the theory of relativity . They invoked a principle , later known as the " EPR criterion of reality " , positing that : " If , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i . e . , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity . " From this , they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured . But quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system . Einstein , Podolsky , and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality .	What does the EPR paradox describe?	The EPR paradox describes a thought experiment where two particles interact in a way that the wavefunction describing them is entangled.

Locker - Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein , during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe . In one of his speeches he denounced Germany ' s treatment of Jews , while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine , as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere . In his speech he described Einstein as a " citizen of the world " who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK . [ note 3 ] Both bills failed , however , and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study , in Princeton , New Jersey , US , to become a resident scholar .	Did both bills submitted by you pass?	No, both bills failed.
After arriving in New York City , Einstein was taken to various places and events , including Chinatown , a lunch with the editors of The New York Times , and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera , where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival . During the days following , he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University , who described Einstein as " the ruling monarch of the mind " . Harry Emerson Fosdick , pastor at New York ' s Riverside Church , gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full - size statue that the church made of Einstein , standing at the entrance . Also during his stay in New York , he joined a crowd of 15 , 000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration .	What event did you attend at the Metropolitan Opera?	I attended a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera.
He also published an essay , " My First Impression of the U . S . A . " , in July 1921 , in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans , much as had Alexis de Tocqueville , who published his own impressions in Democracy in America ( 1835 ) . For some of his observations , Einstein was clearly surprised : " What strikes a visitor is the joyous , positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly , self - confident , optimistic , and without envy . "	Who also published their impressions of Americans?	Alexis de Tocqueville also published his impressions in the book "Democracy in America."
