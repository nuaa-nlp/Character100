Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which after several name changes would become the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single "One Love", a reworking of "People Get Ready"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers released a further eleven studio albums, and after signing to Island Records the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari. Around this time, Marley relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).	Where were you born?

The group started to gain international attention after signing to Island, and touring in support of the albums Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973). Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, Marley carried on under the band's name. The album Natty Dread (1974) received positive reception. In 1975, following the global popularity of Eric Clapton's version of Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff",  Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, with a live version of "No Woman, No Cry", from the Live! album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, Rastaman Vibration (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul Charts. A few months after the album's release Marley survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to permanently relocate to London. During his time in London he recorded the album Exodus (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock and enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success. In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma; he died as a result of the illness in 1981, shortly after baptism into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  His fans around the world expressed their grief, and he received a state funeral in Jamaica.	When did you start gaining international attention?

Bob Marley and Neville Livingston (later known as Bunny Wailer) had been childhood friends in Nine Mile. They had started to play music together while at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Marley left Nine Mile with his mother when he was 12 and moved to Trenchtown, Kingston. She and Thadeus Livingston (Bunny Wailer's father) had a daughter together whom they named Claudette Pearl, who was a younger sister to both Bob and Bunny. Now that Marley and Livingston were living together in the same house in Trenchtown, their musical explorations deepened to include the new ska music, and the latest R&B from United States radio stations whose broadcasts reached Jamaica. Marley formed a vocal group with Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh. The line-up was known variously as the Teenagers, the Wailing Rudeboys, the Wailing Wailers and finally just the Wailers. Joe Higgs, who was part of the successful vocal act Higgs and Wilson, lived nearby and encouraged Marley. Marley and the others did not play any instruments at this time, and were more interested in being a vocal harmony group. Higgs helped them develop their vocal harmonies, and started to teach Marley how to play guitar.	Who were your childhood friends in Nine Mile?	I and Neville Livingston (Bunny Wailer) were childhood friends.

In 1968 , Bob and Rita visited songwriter Jimmy Norman at his apartment in the Bronx . Norman had written the extended lyrics for Kai Winding ' s " Time Is on My Side " ( covered by the Rolling Stones ) and had also written for Johnny Nash and Jimi Hendrix . A three - day jam session with Norman and others , including Norman ' s co - writer Al Pyfrom , resulted in a 24 - minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman - Pyfrom ' s compositions . This tape is , according to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens , rare in that it was influenced by pop rather than reggae , as part of an effort to break Marley into the US charts . According to an article in The New York Times , Marley experimented on the tape with different sounds , adopting a doo - wop style on " Stay With Me " and " the slow love song style of 1960s artists " on " Splish for My Splash " . An artist yet to establish himself outside his native Jamaica , Marley lived in Ridgmount Gardens , Bloomsbury , during 1972 .	Who wrote the extended lyrics for Kai Winding's "Time Is on My Side"?	Jimmy Norman.
Several film adaptations of his life have been made as well . For instance , a feature - length documentary about his life , Rebel Music , won various awards at the Grammys . With contributions from Rita , The Wailers , and Marley ' s lovers and children , it also tells much of the story in his own words . In February 2008 , director Martin Scorsese announced his intention to produce a documentary movie on Marley . The film was set to be released on 6 February 2010 , on what would have been Marley ' s 65th birthday . However , Scorsese dropped out due to scheduling problems . He was replaced by Jonathan Demme , who dropped out due to creative differences with producer Steve Bing during the beginning of editing . Kevin Macdonald replaced Demme and the film , Marley , was released on 20 April 2012 . In 2011 , ex - girlfriend and filmmaker Esther Anderson , along with Gian Godoy , made the documentary Bob Marley : The Making of a Legend , which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival .
