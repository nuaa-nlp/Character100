Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and a solo album before achieving his first top five entry on the UK Singles Chart with "Space Oddity", released in 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with the flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of "Starman" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as "plastic soul", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single "Fame" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the Berlin Trilogy. "Heroes" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.	When did you release your first top five entry on the UK Singles Chart?	I achieved my first top five entry on the UK Singles Chart with "Space Oddity", released in 1969.

From 1953 Bowie moved with his family to Bickley and then Bromley Common, before settling in Sundridge Park in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley (who shared Bowie's birthday) and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song "Tutti Frutti", Bowie later said that he had "heard God".	Where did you move with your family in 1953?	I moved with my family to Bickley and then Bromley Common in 1953.

Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to "Hound Dog" soon after its release in 1956. According to Kristina, she and David "danced like possessed elves" to records of various artists. By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as "mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet". Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance, introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele. After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School. It was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:	Who impressed you with their dance to "Hound Dog"?	I was impressed with Presley when I saw my cousin Kristina dance.

My stage presentation was described as "mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet".
Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to "Hound Dog" soon after its release in 1956. According to Kristina, she and David "danced like possessed elves" to records of various artists. By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as "mesmerizing ... like someone from another planet". Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet singers and other performers preparing for the Royal Variety Performance, introducing him to Alma Cogan and Tommy Steele.

Bowie's maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life. Burns, who was 10 years older than Bowie, had schizophrenia and seizures, and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards; while living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as modern jazz, Buddhism, Beat poetry and the occult. In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie's extended family members had schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a lobotomy; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.

He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.	When did you receive the serious injury at school?	I received the serious injury at school in 1962.

Over the years , Bowie made numerous references to religions and to his evolving spirituality . Beginning in 1967 from the influence of his half - brother , he became interested in Buddhism and , with commercial success eluding him , he considered becoming a Buddhist monk . Biographer Marc Spitz states that the religion reminded the young artist that other goals in life existed outside fame and material gain and one can learn about themselves through meditation and chanting . After a few months ' study at Tibet House in London , he was told by his Lama , Chime Rinpoche , " You don ' t want to be Buddhist .   ... You should follow music . " By 1975 , Bowie admitted , " I felt totally , absolutely alone . And I probably was alone because I pretty much had abandoned God . " In his will , Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali " in accordance with the Buddhist rituals " .	What religions did you make references to over the years?	I made references to Buddhism.
The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was Young Americans ( 1975 ) . Sandford writes , " Over the years , most British rockers had tried , one way or another , to become black - by - extension . Few had succeeded as Bowie did now . " The album ' s sound , which Bowie identified as " plastic soul " , constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees . Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK and yielded Bowie ' s first US number one , " Fame " , a collaboration with John Lennon . A re - issue of the 1969 single " Space Oddity " became Bowie ' s first number - one hit in the UK a few months after " Fame " achieved the same in the US . He mimed " Fame " and his November single " Golden Years " on the US variety show Soul Train , earning him the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the programme . The same year , Bowie fired Defries as his manager . At the culmination of the ensuing months - long legal dispute , he watched , as described by Sandford , " millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered " in what were " uniquely generous terms for Defries " , then " shut himself up in West 20th Street , where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door . " Michael Lippman , Bowie ' s lawyer during the negotiations , became his new manager ; Lippman , in turn , was awarded substantial compensation when he was fired the following year .	What was your first US number one?	My first US number one was "Fame", a collaboration with John Lennon.
Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and enrolled in his dance class at the London Dance Centre . He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image " really blossomed " . " He lived on his emotions , he was a wonderful influence . His day - to - day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen , ever . It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was . I joined the circus . " In January 1968 , Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play , The Pistol Shot , in the Theatre 625 series , and used Bowie with a dancer , Hermione Farthingale ; the pair began dating and moved into a London flat together . Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway to take part in a film , Song of Norway ; this affected him , and several songs , such as " Letter to Hermione " and " An Occasional Dream " , reference her ; and , for the video accompanying " Where Are We Now ? " , he wore a T - shirt with the words " m / s Song of Norway " . Bowie blamed himself for their breakup , saying in 2002 that he " was totally unfaithful and couldn ' t for the life of me keep it zipped . " Farthingale , who spoke of deep affection for him in an interview with Pegg , said they last saw each other in 1970 .	What was your perception of Kemp's day-to-day life?	I described Kemp's day-to-day life as the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, everything I thought Bohemia probably was.
In October 2001 , Bowie opened the Concert for New York City , a charity event to benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks , with a minimalist performance of Simon & Garfunkel ' s " America " , followed by a full band performance of " ' Heroes ' " . 2002 saw the release of Heathen , and , during the second half of the year , the Heathen Tour . Taking place in Europe and North America , the tour opened at London ' s annual Meltdown festival , for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director . Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass , Television and the Dandy Warhols . As well as songs from the new album , the tour featured material from Bowie ' s Low era . Reality ( 2003 ) followed , and its accompanying world tour , the A Reality Tour , with an estimated attendance of 722 , 000 , grossed more than any other in 2004 . On 13   June , Bowie headlined the last night of the Isle of Wight Festival 2004 . On 25   June , he experienced chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Schee ß el , Germany . Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder , the pain was later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery , requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg . The remaining fourteen dates of the tour were cancelled .	What songs did you perform at the Concert for New York City?	I performed a minimalist version of Simon & Garfunkel's "America" followed by a full band performance of "'Heroes'".
The final piece in what Bowie called his " triptych " , Lodger ( 1979 ) , eschewed the minimalist , ambient nature of its two predecessors , making a partial return to the drum - and guitar - based rock and pop of his pre - Berlin era . The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music , in places incorporating Hijaz non - Western scales . Some tracks were composed using Eno ' s Oblique Strategies cards : " Boys Keep Swinging " entailed band members swapping instruments , " Move On " used the chords from Bowie ' s early composition " All the Young Dudes " played backwards , and " Red Money " took backing tracks from The Idiot ' s " Sister Midnight " . The album was recorded in Switzerland and New York City . Ahead of its release , RCA ' s Mel Ilberman described it as " a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer , shunned and victimized by life ' s pressures and technology . " Lodger reached number four in the UK and number 20 in the US , and yielded the UK hit singles " Boys Keep Swinging " and " DJ " . Towards the end of the year , Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings , and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980 . The three albums were later adapted into classical music symphonies by American composer Philip Glass for his first , fourth and twelfth symphonies in 1992 , 1997 and 2019 , respectively . Glass praised Bowie ' s gift for creating " fairly complex pieces of music , masquerading as simple pieces " .	What were some of the methods you used to compose tracks on your album Lodger?	Some tracks on my album Lodger were composed using Eno's Oblique Strategies cards, band members swapping instruments, and playing the chords from my early composition "All the Young Dudes" backwards.
From July 1980 to January 1981 , Bowie played Joseph Merrick in the Broadway theatre production The Elephant Man , which he undertook wearing no stage make - up , earning critical praise for his performance . Christiane F . , a 1981 biographical film focusing on a young girl ' s drug addiction in West Berlin , featured Bowie in a cameo appearance as himself at a concert in Germany . Its soundtrack album , Christiane F . ( 1981 ) , featured much material from his Berlin albums . The following year , he starred in the titular role in a BBC adaptation of the Bertolt Brecht play Baal . Bowie made three on - screen appearances in 1983 , the first as a vampire in Tony Scott ' s erotic horror film The Hunger , with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon . Bowie later said that he felt " very uncomfortable " with the role , but was happy to work with Scott . The second was in Nagisa Ō shima ' s Merry Christmas , Mr . Lawrence , based on Laurens van der Post ' s novel The Seed and the Sower , in which he played Major Jack Celliers , a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp . While the film itself received mixed reviews , Bowie ' s performance was praised . Pegg places it amongst his finest acting performances . Bowie ' s third role in 1983 was a small cameo in Mel Damski ' s pirate comedy Yellowbeard , heralded by several members of the Monty Python group . Bowie also filmed a 30 - second introduction to the animated film The Snowman , based on Raymond Briggs ' s book of the same name .	Who did you play in the Broadway theatre production The Elephant Man?	I played Joseph Merrick.
Bowie moved to the US in 1974 , initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles . Diamond Dogs ( 1974 ) , parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk , was the product of two distinct ideas : a musical based on a wild future in a post - apocalyptic city , and setting George Orwell ' s Nineteen Eighty - Four to music . The album went to number one in the UK , spawning the hits " Rebel Rebel " and " Diamond Dogs " , and number five in the US . The supporting Diamond Dogs Tour visited cities in North America between June and December 1974 . Choreographed by Toni Basil , and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects , the high - budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob . The resulting documentary , Cracked Actor , featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie : the tour coincided with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction , producing severe physical debilitation , paranoia and emotional problems . He later commented that the accompanying live album , David Live , ought to have been titled " David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory " . David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie ' s status as a superstar , charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US . It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of Eddie Floyd ' s " Knock on Wood " . After a break in Philadelphia , where Bowie recorded new material , the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul .	What were the two distinct ideas behind your album Diamond Dogs?	The two distinct ideas behind my album Diamond Dogs were a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four to music.

Conn quickly began to promote Bowie . His debut single , " Liza Jane " , credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees , was not commercially successful . Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin ' Wolf and Willie Dixon covers , Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys , another blues outfit , who incorporated folk and soul — " I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger " , he recalled . Their cover of Bobby Bland ' s " I Pity the Fool " was no more successful than " Liza Jane " , and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third , a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who . " You ' ve Got a Habit of Leaving " fared no better , signalling the end of Conn ' s contract . Declaring that he would exit the pop music world " to study mime at Sadler ' s Wells " , Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third . His new manager , Ralph Horton , later instrumental in his transition to solo artist , helped secure him a contract with Pye Records . Publicist Tony Hatch signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs . Dissatisfied with Davy ( and Davie ) Jones , which in the mid - 1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees , he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th - century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised . His first release under the name was the January 1966 single " Can ' t Help Thinking About Me " , recorded with the Lower Third . It flopped like its predecessors .	Who were you dissatisfied with and why?	I was dissatisfied with the King Bees because their repertoire consisted of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon covers.

Bowie departed the Lower Third after the single ' s release , partly due to Horton ' s influence , and released two more singles for Pye , " Do Anything You Say " and " I Dig Everything " , both of which featured a new band called the Buzz , before signing with Deram Records . Around this time Bowie also joined the Riot Squad ; their recordings , which included one of Bowie ' s original songs and material by the Velvet Underground , went unreleased . Kenneth Pitt , introduced by Horton , took over as Bowie ' s manager . His April 1967 solo single , " The Laughing Gnome " , on which speeded - up and high - pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome , failed to chart . Released six weeks later , his album debut , David Bowie , an amalgam of pop , psychedelia and music hall , met the same fate . It was his last release for two years . In September , Bowie recorded " Let Me Sleep Beside You " and " Karma Man " , both rejected by Deram and left unreleased until 1970 .
