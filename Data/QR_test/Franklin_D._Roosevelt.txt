With World War II looming after 1938 in addition to the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China as well as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union while the United States remained officially neutral.

Their father graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather, James Roosevelt.

As a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, and sail; he also learned to play polo, tennis, and golf.

He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks. Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service. Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president.	What activities did you learn as a child?

Like most of his Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to Harvard College. He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and the Fly Club, and served as a school cheerleader.

Roosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics . Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore , Franklin shared his father ' s bond with the Democratic Party , and in preparation for the 1910 elections , the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly . Roosevelt was a compelling recruit for the party . He had the personality and energy for campaigning , and he had the money to pay for his own campaign . But Roosevelt ' s campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent , Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler , chose to seek re - election . Rather than putting his political hopes on hold , Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate . The senate district , located in Dutchess , Columbia , and Putnam , was strongly Republican . Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign , but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences . Acting as his own campaign manager , Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car . Due to his aggressive campaign , his name recognition in the Hudson Valley , and the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections , Roosevelt won a surprising victory .	What position were you recruited to run for in the 1910 elections?	I was recruited to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly.

The Republicans nominated Thomas E . Dewey , the governor of New York , who had a reputation as a liberal in his party . They accused the Roosevelt administration of domestic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency , but Dewey ' s most effective gambit was to raise discreetly the age issue . He assailed the President as a " tired old man " with " tired old men " in his cabinet , pointedly suggesting that the President ' s lack of vigor had produced a less than vigorous economic recovery . Roosevelt , as most observers could see from his weight loss and haggard appearance , was a tired man in 1944 . But upon entering the campaign in earnest in late September 1944 , Roosevelt displayed enough passion and fight to allay most concerns and to deflect Republican attacks . With the war still raging , he urged voters not to " change horses in mid - stream . " Labor unions , which had grown rapidly in the war , fully supported Roosevelt . Roosevelt and Truman won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin , defeating Dewey and his running mate John W . Bricker with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes . The president campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations , so his victory symbolized support for the nation ' s future participation in the international community .

With Roosevelt ' s influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 , conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs . Roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation , including the Housing Act of 1937 , a second Agricultural Adjustment Act , and the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) of 1938 , which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation . The FLSA outlawed child labor , established a federal minimum wage , and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of forty - hours per week . He also won passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President , making it " the nerve center of the federal administrative system . " When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid - 1937 , during the onset of the recession of 1937 – 1938 , Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States , alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy ( of which they found none ) . He then asked Congress for $ 5   billion ( equivalent to $ 94.25   billion in 2021 ) in relief and public works funding . This managed to eventually create as many as 3.3   million WPA jobs by 1938 . Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks , bridges , and other infrastructure across the country , and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations — investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources . Beyond this , however , Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act , administrative reorganization , and regional planning measures , all of which were leftovers from a regular session . According to Burns , this attempt illustrated Roosevelt ' s inability to settle on a basic economic program .	What types of projects were accomplished under the WPA?	Projects accomplished under the WPA included the construction of federal courthouses, post offices, facilities and infrastructure for national parks, bridges, and other infrastructure across the country. Additionally, architectural surveys and archaeological excavations were conducted to preserve important resources.
His Second Bill of Rights became , according to historian Joshua Zeitz , " the basis of the Democratic Party ' s aspirations for the better part of four decades . " After his death , his widow , Eleanor , continued to be a forceful presence in U . S . and world politics , serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally . Some junior New Dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of Truman , John Kennedy , and Lyndon Johnson . Kennedy came from a Roosevelt - hating family . Historian William Leuchtenburg says that before 1960 , " Kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify himself as a New Deal liberal . " He adds , as president , " Kennedy never wholly embraced the Roosevelt tradition and at times he deliberately severed himself from it . " By contrast , young Lyndon Johnson had been an enthusiastic New Dealer and a favorite of Roosevelt . Johnson modelled his presidency on Roosevelt ' s and relied heavily on New Deal lawyer Abe Fortas , as well as James H . Rowe , Anna M . Rosenberg , Thomas Gardiner Corcoran , and Benjamin V . Cohen .	Who is the historian who referred to the Second Bill of Rights as the basis of the Democratic Party's aspirations?	Joshua Zeitz.

World War II dominated Roosevelt ' s attention , with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before . Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation ' s economic , financial , and institutional resources for the war effort . Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands . Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions , working closely with his generals and admirals , the war and Navy departments , the British , and even the Soviet Union . His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins ( who was based in the White House ) , Sumner Welles ( based in the State Department ) , and Henry Morgenthau Jr . at Treasury . In military affairs , Roosevelt worked most closely with Secretary Henry L . Stimson at the War Department , Army Chief of Staff George Marshall , and Admiral William D . Leahy .

In 1942 , with the United States now in the conflict , war production increased dramatically but fell short of the goals established by the president , due in part to manpower shortages . The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes , especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries , which lasted well into 1944 . Nonetheless , between 1941 and 1945 , the United States produced 2.4   million trucks , 300 , 000 military aircraft , 88 , 400 tanks , and 40   billion rounds of ammunition . The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries ; for example , in 1944 , the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany , Japan , Britain , and the Soviet Union . The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation , conciliation or arbitration . One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace , who headed the Board of Economic Warfare , and Jesse H . Jones , in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ; both agencies assumed responsibility for the acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding . Roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies . In 1943 , Roosevelt established the Office of War Mobilization to oversee the home front ; the agency was led by James F . Byrnes , who came to be known as the " assistant president " due to his influence .	What were some of the major items produced by the United States during World War II?

By late 1940 , re - armament was in high gear , partly to expand and re - equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the " Arsenal of Democracy " for Britain and other countries . With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941 , Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world . Assisted by Willkie , Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend - Lease program , which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain , and China . In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I , there would be no repayment after the war . As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan , Germany , and Italy , American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger . When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend - Lease to the Soviets . Thus , Roosevelt had committed the U . S . to the Allied side with a policy of " all aid short of war . " By July 1941 , Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter - American Affairs ( OCIAA ) to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy .	Why was re-armament happening?	Partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy, and partly to become the "Arsenal of Democracy" for Britain and other countries.

With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941 , Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world . Assisted by Willkie , Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend - Lease program , which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain , and China . In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I , there would be no repayment after the war . As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan , Germany , and Italy , American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger . When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend - Lease to the Soviets . Thus , Roosevelt had committed the U . S . to the Allied side with a policy of " all aid short of war . " By July 1941 , Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter - American Affairs ( OCIAA ) to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy .	Who helped you win Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program?	Willkie.
With Roosevelt ' s influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 , conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs . Roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation , including the Housing Act of 1937 , a second Agricultural Adjustment Act , and the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) of 1938 , which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation . The FLSA outlawed child labor , established a federal minimum wage , and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of forty - hours per week . He also won passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President , making it " the nerve center of the federal administrative system . " When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid - 1937 , during the onset of the recession of 1937 – 1938 , Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States , alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy ( of which they found none ) . He then asked Congress for $ 5   billion ( equivalent to $ 94.25   billion in 2021 ) in relief and public works funding . This managed to eventually create as many as 3.3   million WPA jobs by 1938 . Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks , bridges , and other infrastructure across the country , and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations — investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources . Beyond this , however , Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act , administrative reorganization , and regional planning measures , all of which were leftovers from a regular session . According to Burns , this attempt illustrated Roosevelt ' s inability to settle on a basic economic program .	How did you address the economic downturn in the mid-1937?	I launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States, alleging a capital strike as the cause of the recession. I also requested $5 billion in relief and public works funding from Congress.
