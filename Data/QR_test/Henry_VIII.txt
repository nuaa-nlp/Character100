Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution, expanding royal power and ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings in opposition to papal supremacy. He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial by means of bills of attainder. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, Thomas Cromwell, and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in his administration.	Who are you known for?	My radical changes to the English Constitution.

Henry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament. He converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance as well as costly and largely unproductive wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, King James V of Scotland and the Scottish regency under the Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise. He expanded the Royal Navy, oversaw the annexure of Wales to England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542.	What were your sources of money?	The proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament and the money formerly paid to Rome were my sources of money.

Born on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. Of the young Henry's six (or seven) siblings, only three – his brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, and sisters Margaret and Mary – survived infancy. He was baptised by Richard Foxe, the Bishop of Exeter, at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace. In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. The day after the ceremony, he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. The reason for giving such appointments to a small child was to enable his father to retain personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families. Not much is known about Henry's early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king, but it is known that he received a first-rate education from leading tutors. He became fluent in Latin and French and learned at least some Italian.	When and where were you born?	I was born on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent.

In 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of sweating sickness, just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine. Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall, and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504. Henry VII gave his second son few responsibilities even after the death of Arthur. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne "untrained in the exacting art of kingship".	When did Arthur die?	Arthur died in 1502.

Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his son Henry in marriage to the widowed Catherine. Both Henry VII and Catherine's mother Queen Isabella were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death. On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later. A papal dispensation was only needed for the "impediment of public honesty" if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her duenna claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for "affinity", which took account of the possibility of consummation. Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young. Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile, complicated matters. Catherine's father Ferdinand preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated. Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.	Who did you offer your son Henry in marriage to?	I offered my son Henry in marriage to Catherine.

Henry VII died on 21 April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion. The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine. Whether or not this was true, it was certainly convenient. Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter Eleanor, Catherine's niece, to Henry; she had now been jilted. Henry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friar's church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509. Henry claimed descent from Constantine the Great and King Arthur and saw himself as their successor.	When did you die?	I died on 21 April 1509.

In 1510 , France , with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai , was winning a war against Venice . Henry renewed his father ' s friendship with Louis XII of France , an issue that divided his council . Certainly , war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult . Shortly thereafter , however , Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon . After Pope Julius II created the anti - French Holy League in October 1511 , Henry followed Ferdinand ' s lead and brought England into the new League . An initial joint Anglo - Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England , the start of making Henry ' s dreams of ruling France a reality . The attack , however , following a formal declaration of war in April 1512 , was not led by Henry personally and was a considerable failure ; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends , and it strained the Anglo - Spanish alliance . Nevertheless , the French were pushed out of Italy soon after , and the alliance survived , with both parties keen to win further victories over the French . Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League . Remarkably , Henry had secured the promised title of " Most Christian King of France " from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris , if only Louis could be defeated .	Who did you convince to join the Holy League?	I convinced Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League.
The day after Anne ' s execution the 45 - year - old Henry became engaged to Seymour , who had been one of the queen ' s ladies - in - waiting . They were married ten days later at the Palace of Whitehall , Whitehall , London , in the queen ' s closet , by Stephen Gardiner , Bishop of Winchester . On 12 October 1537 , Jane gave birth to a son , Prince Edward , the future Edward VI . The birth was difficult , and Queen Jane died on 24 October 1537 from an infection and was buried in Windsor . The euphoria that had accompanied Edward ' s birth became sorrow , but it was only over time that Henry came to long for his wife . At the time , Henry recovered quickly from the shock . Measures were immediately put in place to find another wife for Henry , which , at the insistence of Cromwell and the Privy Council , were focused on the European continent .	Who did you become engaged to after Anne's execution?	I became engaged to Seymour.
In the winter of 1532 , Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted the support of the French king for his new marriage . Immediately upon returning to Dover in England , Henry , now 41 , and Anne went through a secret wedding service . She soon became pregnant , and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533 . On 23 May 1533 , Cranmer , sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the king ' s marriage to Catherine of Aragon , declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void . Five days later , on 28 May 1533 , Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid . Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen , becoming instead " princess dowager " as the widow of Arthur . In her place , Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 . The queen gave birth to a daughter slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533 . The child was christened Elizabeth , in honour of Henry ' s mother , Elizabeth of York .	When was your second wedding service with Anne held?	On 25 January 1533.
The Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529 , which was followed by a period of uncertainty . This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy , Duke of Richmond and the king ' s son , as lord lieutenant . Richmond had never before visited Ireland , his appointment a break with past policy . For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes , but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective . Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell , who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted . Kildare , on the other hand , was summoned to London ; after some hesitation , he departed for London in 1534 , where he would face charges of treason . His son , Thomas , Lord Offaly , was more forthright , denouncing the king and leading a " Catholic crusade " against the king , who was by this time mired in marital problems . Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered and besieged Dublin . Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes , although he failed to secure the support of Lord Darcy , a sympathiser , or Charles V . What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2 , 000 English troops – a large army by Irish standards – and the execution of Offaly ( his father was already dead ) and his uncles .	Who was summoned to London and faced charges of treason in 1534?	Kildare was summoned to London and faced charges of treason in 1534.
A particular focus of modern historiography has been the extent to which the events of Henry ' s life ( including his marriages , foreign policy and religious changes ) were the result of his own initiative and , if they were , whether they were the result of opportunism or of a principled undertaking by Henry . The traditional interpretation of those events was provided by historian A . F . Pollard , who in 1902 presented his own , largely positive , view of the king , lauding him , " as the king and statesman who , whatever his personal failings , led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire " . Pollard ' s interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry ' s life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G . R . Elton in 1953 .	What did your doctoral thesis in 1953 challenge?	My doctoral thesis in 1953 challenged the traditional interpretation of Henry's life provided by A.F. Pollard.
Following the marriage , there was a period of consolidation , taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues , whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge , convincing the public of their legitimacy , and exposing and dealing with opponents . Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others , these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell , Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself . With this process complete , in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor , leaving Cromwell as Henry ' s chief minister . With the Act of Succession 1533 , Catherine ' s daughter , Mary , was declared illegitimate ; Henry ' s marriage to Anne was declared legitimate ; and Anne ' s issue declared to be next in the line of succession . With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 , Parliament recognised the king ' s status as head of the church in England and , together with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532 , abolished the right of appeal to Rome . It was only then that Pope Clement VII took the step of excommunicating the king and Cranmer , although the excommunication was not made official until some time later . [ nb 3 ]	When did Pope Clement VII excommunicate you and Cranmer?	Pope Clement VII excommunicated me and Cranmer, although the excommunication was not made official until some time later.
Other missions concentrated on arranging an ecclesiastical court to meet in England , with a representative from Clement VII . Although Clement agreed to the creation of such a court , he never had any intention of empowering his legate , Lorenzo Campeggio , to decide in Henry ' s favour . This bias was perhaps the result of pressure from Emperor Charles V , Catherine ' s nephew , but it is not clear how far this influenced either Campeggio or the Pope . After less than two months of hearing evidence , Clement called the case back to Rome in July 1529 , from which it was clear that it would never re - emerge . With the chance for an annulment lost , Cardinal Wolsey bore the blame . He was charged with praemunire in October 1529 , and his fall from grace was " sudden and total " . Briefly reconciled with Henry ( and officially pardoned ) in the first half of 1530 , he was charged once more in November 1530 , this time for treason , but died while awaiting trial . After a short period in which Henry took government upon his own shoulders , Sir Thomas More took on the role of Lord Chancellor and chief minister . Intelligent and able , but a devout Catholic and opponent of the annulment , More initially cooperated with the king ' s new policy , denouncing Wolsey in Parliament .	What happened to you after being charged with praemunire?	I fell from grace after being charged with praemunire in October 1529. My fall was described as "sudden and total".

Who did you sign a pact with after your friendship with Louis XII?	I signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon.
On 30 June 1513 , Henry invaded France , and his troops defeated a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – a relatively minor result , but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes . Soon after , the English took Th é rouanne and handed it over to Maximillian ; Tournai , a more significant settlement , followed . Henry had led the army personally , complete with a large entourage . His absence from the country , however , had prompted his brother - in - law James IV of Scotland to invade England at the behest of Louis . Nevertheless , the English army , overseen by Queen Catherine , decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513 . Among the dead was the Scottish king , thus ending Scotland ' s brief involvement in the war . These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired . However , despite initial indications , he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign . He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return ; England ' s coffers were now empty . With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X , who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France , Henry signed his own treaty with Louis : his sister Mary would become Louis ' wife , having previously been pledged to the younger Charles , and peace was secured for eight years , a remarkably long time .	Who invaded England at my behest while you were away?	James IV of Scotland invaded England at your behest.

The extent to which the events of my life were the result of my own initiative and, if they were, whether they were the result of opportunism or a principled undertaking by me.
Henry ' s precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on . Henry himself , at least in the early part of his reign , was a devout and well - informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ( " Defence of the Seven Sacraments " ) earned him the title of Fidei Defensor ( Defender of the Faith ) from Pope Leo X . The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy , albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms . It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage . Certainly , by 1527 , he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was " blighted in the eyes of God " . Indeed , in marrying Catherine , his brother ' s wife , he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20 : 21 , a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null . [ nb 2 ] Martin Luther , on the other hand , had initially argued against the annulment , stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce . Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment . It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled , forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack . In going public , all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost . Henry sent his secretary , William Knight , to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull . Knight was unsuccessful ; the Pope could not be misled so easily .	What argument did you take to Pope Clement VII in 1527?	I took the argument that the Pope lacked the authority to grant a dispensation for my marriage to Catherine to Pope Clement VII in 1527.

Following the marriage , there was a period of consolidation , taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues , whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge , convincing the public of their legitimacy , and exposing and dealing with opponents . Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others , these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell , Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself . With this process complete , in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor , leaving Cromwell as Henry ' s chief minister . With the Act of Succession 1533 , Catherine ' s daughter , Mary , was declared illegitimate ; Henry ' s marriage to Anne was declared legitimate ; and Anne ' s issue declared to be next in the line of succession .

In 1510 , France , with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai , was winning a war against Venice . Henry renewed his father ' s friendship with Louis XII of France , an issue that divided his council . Certainly , war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult . Shortly thereafter , however , Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon . After Pope Julius II created the anti - French Holy League in October 1511 , Henry followed Ferdinand ' s lead and brought England into the new League . An initial joint Anglo - Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England , the start of making Henry ' s dreams of ruling France a reality . The attack , however , following a formal declaration of war in April 1512 , was not led by Henry personally and was a considerable failure ; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends , and it strained the Anglo - Spanish alliance . Nevertheless , the French were pushed out of Italy soon after , and the alliance survived , with both parties keen to win further victories over the French . Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League . Remarkably , Henry had secured the promised title of " Most Christian King of France " from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris , if only Louis could be defeated .	When did Pope Julius II create the anti-French Holy League?	Pope Julius II created the anti-French Holy League in October 1511.

With the Act of Succession 1533 , Catherine ' s daughter , Mary , was declared illegitimate ; Henry ' s marriage to Anne was declared legitimate ; and Anne ' s issue declared to be next in the line of succession . With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 , Parliament recognised the king ' s status as head of the church in England and , together with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532 , abolished the right of appeal to Rome . It was only then that Pope Clement VII took the step of excommunicating the king and Cranmer , although the excommunication was not made official until some time later . [ nb 3 ]	What happened to you after the marriage?	I resigned as Lord Chancellor in May 1532.
In 1510 , France , with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai , was winning a war against Venice . Henry renewed his father ' s friendship with Louis XII of France , an issue that divided his council . Certainly , war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult . Shortly thereafter , however , Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand II of Aragon . After Pope Julius II created the anti - French Holy League in October 1511 , Henry followed Ferdinand ' s lead and brought England into the new League . An initial joint Anglo - Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England , the start of making Henry ' s dreams of ruling France a reality . The attack , however , following a formal declaration of war in April 1512 , was not led by Henry personally and was a considerable failure ; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends , and it strained the Anglo - Spanish alliance . Nevertheless , the French were pushed out of Italy soon after , and the alliance survived , with both parties keen to win further victories over the French . Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing Emperor Maximilian to join the Holy League . Remarkably , Henry had secured the promised title of " Most Christian King of France " from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris , if only Louis could be defeated .	Who did you renew your father's friendship with?	I renewed my father's friendship with Louis XII of France.
