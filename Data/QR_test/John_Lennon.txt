Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called "the smart Beatle", he was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Through his songwriting in the Beatles, Lennon embraced a myriad of musical influences, initially writing and co-writing rock and pop-oriented hit songs in the band's early years, then later incorporating experimental elements into his compositions in the latter half of the Beatles' career as his songs became known for their increasing innovation. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including How I Won the War, and authoring In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with "All You Need Is Love", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins for Peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.	Where were you born?	I was born in Liverpool.

Lennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia (née Stanley) (1914–1958) and Alfred Lennon (1912–1976). Alfred was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of his son's birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John "Jack" Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9 Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944.

After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon.	When and where were you born?	I was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital.

In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them – with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins – and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her. According to author Mark Lewisohn, however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. Billy Hall, who witnessed the incident, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate. Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.	Who visited your father in July 1946?	My father

He regularly visited his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas. During the school holidays Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey, another cousin, and the three often travelled to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine, Arthur Askey, Max Bygraves and Joe Loss, with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby. After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, "John, cousin Leila and I were very close.

In 1956, Julia bought John his first guitar.

Brian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967 . He had no previous experience managing artists , but he had a strong influence on the group ' s dress code and attitude on stage . Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance , but eventually complied , saying " I ' ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody ' s going to pay me . " McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg , and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr ; this completed the four - piece line - up that would remain until the group ' s break - up in 1970 . The band ' s first single , " Love Me Do " , was released in October 1962 and reached No . 17 on the British charts . They recorded their debut album , Please Please Me , in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963 , a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold , which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day , " Twist and Shout " . The Lennon – McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks . With a few exceptions , one being the album title itself , Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics , saying : " We were just writing songs   ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound . And the words were almost irrelevant " . In a 1987 interview , McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon : " He was like our own little Elvis   ... We all looked up to John . He was older and he was very much the leader ; he was the quickest wit and the smartest . "	Who replaced Pete Best as the drummer in the Beatles?	Ringo Starr replaced Pete Best as the drummer in the Beatles.
The Beatles were performing at Liverpool ' s Cavern Club in November 1961 when they were introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert . Epstein was homosexual and closeted , and according to biographer Philip Norman , one of Epstein ' s reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon . Almost as soon as Julian was born , Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein , which led to speculation about their relationship . When he was later questioned about it , Lennon said , " Well , it was almost a love affair , but not quite . It was never consummated . But it was a pretty intense relationship . It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual . We used to sit in a caf é in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I ' d say , ' Do you like that one ? Do you like this one ? ' I was rather enjoying the experience , thinking like a writer all the time : I am experiencing this . " Soon after their return from Spain , at McCartney ' s twenty - first birthday party in June 1963 , Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying " How was your honeymoon , John ? " The MC , known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks , was making a joke , but ten months had passed since Lennon ' s marriage , and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future . Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple : " He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in . "	Why did you physically attack Bob Wooler?	I physically attacked Bob Wooler because the MC made a joke about my honeymoon, saying "How was your honeymoon, John?" This happened at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963.
McCartney recommended that his friend George Harrison become the lead guitarist . Lennon thought that Harrison , then 14 years old , was too young . McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus , where Harrison played " Raunchy " for Lennon and was asked to join . Stuart Sutcliffe , Lennon ' s friend from art school , later joined as bassist . Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Sutcliffe became " The Beatles " in early 1960 . In August that year , the Beatles were engaged for a 48 - night residency in Hamburg , in West Germany , and were desperately in need of a drummer . They asked Pete Best to join them . Lennon ' s aunt , horrified when he told her about the trip , pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead . After the first Hamburg residency , the band accepted another in April 1961 , and a third in April 1962 . As with the other band members , Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg , and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long , overnight performances .

On 23 March 1973 , Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days . Ono , meanwhile , was granted permanent residence . In response , Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association , where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia ; a place with " no land , no boundaries , no passports , only people " . Waving the white flag of Nutopia ( two handkerchiefs ) , they asked for political asylum in the US . The press conference was filmed , and appeared in a 2006 documentary , The U . S . vs . John Lennon . [ nb 9 ] Soon after the press conference , Nixon ' s involvement in a political scandal came to light , and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington , DC . They led to the president ' s resignation 14 months later . In December 1974 , when he and members of his tour entourage visited the White House , Harrison asked Gerald Ford , Nixon ' s successor , to intercede in the matter . Ford ' s administration showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon , and the deportation order was overturned in 1975 . The following year , Lennon received his green card certifying his permanent residency , and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977 , Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball .	Where did you and Ono hold the press conference?	We held the press conference at the New York City Bar Association.
Two years before the Beatles disbanded , Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War . They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969 , and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam , campaigning with a week - long Bed - In for Peace . They planned another Bed - In in the United States , but were denied entry , so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , where they recorded " Give Peace a Chance " . They often combined advocacy with performance art , as in their " Bagism " , first introduced during a Vienna press conference . Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song " The Ballad of John and Yoko " . Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969 , adding " Ono " as a middle name . The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building , where the Beatles had performed their rooftop concert three months earlier . Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter , some official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon . The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire . After Ono was injured in a car accident , Lennon arranged for a king - size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles ' album , Abbey Road .	When did you and Ono begin your public protests against the Vietnam War?	Two years before the Beatles disbanded.
The British critic Nik Cohn observed of Lennon , " He owned one of the best pop voices ever , rasped and smashed and brooding , always fierce . " Cohn wrote that Lennon , performing " Twist and Shout " , would " rant his way into total incoherence , half rupture himself . " When the Beatles recorded the song , the final track during the mammoth one - day session that produced the band ' s 1963 debut album , Please Please Me , Lennon ' s voice , already compromised by a cold , came close to giving out . Lennon said , " I couldn ' t sing the damn thing , I was just screaming . " In the words of biographer Barry Miles , " Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock ' n ' roll . " The Beatles ' producer , George Martin , tells how Lennon " had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand . He was always saying to me : ' DO something with my voice !   ... put something on it   ... Make it different . ' " Martin obliged , often using double - tracking and other techniques . [ citation needed ]	How do you feel about your own voice according to your biographer Barry Miles?	According to Barry Miles, I had an inborn dislike of my own voice.
Led by Harrison and Lennon ' s interest , the Beatles travelled to the Maharishi ' s ashram in India in February 1968 for further guidance . While there , they composed most of the songs for their double album The Beatles , but the band members ' mixed experience with Transcendental Meditation signalled a sharp divergence in the group ' s camaraderie . On their return to London , they became increasingly involved in business activities with the formation of Apple Corps , a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies . Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve " artistic freedom within a business structure " . Released amid the Protests of 1968 , the band ' s debut single for the Apple label included Lennon ' s B - side " Revolution " , in which he called for a " plan " rather than committing to Maoist revolution . The song ' s pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the New Left press . Adding to the tensions at the Beatles ' recording sessions that year , Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend , the Japanese artist Yoko Ono , beside him , thereby contravening the band ' s policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio . He was especially pleased with his songwriting contributions to the double album and identified it as a superior work to Sgt . Pepper . At the end of 1968 , Lennon participated in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus , a television special that was not broadcast . Lennon performed with the Dirty Mac , a supergroup composed of Lennon , Eric Clapton , Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell . The group also backed a vocal performance by Ono . A film version was released in 1996 .	What is Apple Corps?	Apple Corps is a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies.
Along with his estrangement from McCartney , Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music . During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death , according to Fred Seaman , Lennon and Ono ' s assistant at the time , Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material . Lennon took notice when McCartney released " Coming Up " in 1980 , which was the year Lennon returned to the studio . " It ' s driving me crackers ! " he jokingly complained , because he could not get the tune out of his head . That same year , Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends , and he replied that they were neither , and that he had not seen any of them in a long time . But he also said , " I still love those guys . The Beatles are over , but John , Paul , George and Ringo go on . "	Did you still have love for the other members of The Beatles?	Yes, I said I still loved those guys and that John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.

Led by Harrison and Lennon ' s interest , the Beatles travelled to the Maharishi ' s ashram in India in February 1968 for further guidance . While there , they composed most of the songs for their double album The Beatles , but the band members ' mixed experience with Transcendental Meditation signalled a sharp divergence in the group ' s camaraderie . On their return to London , they became increasingly involved in business activities with the formation of Apple Corps , a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies . Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve " artistic freedom within a business structure " . Released amid the Protests of 1968 , the band ' s debut single for the Apple label included Lennon ' s B - side " Revolution " , in which he called for a " plan " rather than committing to Maoist revolution . The song ' s pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the New Left press . Adding to the tensions at the Beatles ' recording sessions that year , Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend , the Japanese artist Yoko Ono , beside him , thereby contravening the band ' s policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio . He was especially pleased with his songwriting contributions to the double album and identified it as a superior work to Sgt . Pepper . At the end of 1968 , Lennon participated in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus , a television special that was not broadcast . Lennon performed with the Dirty Mac , a supergroup composed of Lennon , Eric Clapton , Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell . The group also backed a vocal performance by Ono . A film version was released in 1996 .	Who led the Beatles to travel to the Maharishi's ashram in India?	Harrison and my interest.
The Beatles were performing at Liverpool ' s Cavern Club in November 1961 when they were introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert . Epstein was homosexual and closeted , and according to biographer Philip Norman , one of Epstein ' s reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon . Almost as soon as Julian was born , Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein , which led to speculation about their relationship . When he was later questioned about it , Lennon said , " Well , it was almost a love affair , but not quite . It was never consummated . But it was a pretty intense relationship . It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual . We used to sit in a caf é in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I ' d say , ' Do you like that one ? Do you like this one ? ' I was rather enjoying the experience , thinking like a writer all the time : I am experiencing this . " Soon after their return from Spain , at McCartney ' s twenty - first birthday party in June 1963 , Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying " How was your honeymoon , John ? " The MC , known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks , was making a joke , but ten months had passed since Lennon ' s marriage , and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future . Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple : " He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in . "	What was the reason behind your attack on Wooler?	The reason behind my attack on Wooler was that Wooler had called me a queer, which angered me and led me to assault Wooler's ribs.
Two years before the Beatles disbanded , Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War . They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969 , and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam , campaigning with a week - long Bed - In for Peace . They planned another Bed - In in the United States , but were denied entry , so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal , where they recorded " Give Peace a Chance " . They often combined advocacy with performance art , as in their " Bagism " , first introduced during a Vienna press conference . Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song " The Ballad of John and Yoko " . Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969 , adding " Ono " as a middle name . The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building , where the Beatles had performed their rooftop concert three months earlier . Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter , some official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon . The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire . After Ono was injured in a car accident , Lennon arranged for a king - size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles ' album , Abbey Road .	Where did you and Ono spend your honeymoon?	The Hilton Amsterdam.

I was introduced to Brian Epstein at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961.
Brian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967 . He had no previous experience managing artists , but he had a strong influence on the group ' s dress code and attitude on stage . Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance , but eventually complied , saying " I ' ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody ' s going to pay me . " McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg , and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr ; this completed the four - piece line - up that would remain until the group ' s break - up in 1970 . The band ' s first single , " Love Me Do " , was released in October 1962 and reached No . 17 on the British charts . They recorded their debut album , Please Please Me , in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963 , a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold , which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day , " Twist and Shout " . The Lennon – McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks . With a few exceptions , one being the album title itself , Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics , saying : " We were just writing songs   ... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound . And the words were almost irrelevant " . In a 1987 interview , McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon : " He was like our own little Elvis   ... We all looked up to John . He was older and he was very much the leader ; he was the quickest wit and the smartest . "	Who managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967?	Brian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967.
McCartney recommended that his friend George Harrison become the lead guitarist . Lennon thought that Harrison , then 14 years old , was too young . McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus , where Harrison played " Raunchy " for Lennon and was asked to join . Stuart Sutcliffe , Lennon ' s friend from art school , later joined as bassist . Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Sutcliffe became " The Beatles " in early 1960 . In August that year , the Beatles were engaged for a 48 - night residency in Hamburg , in West Germany , and were desperately in need of a drummer . They asked Pete Best to join them . Lennon ' s aunt , horrified when he told her about the trip , pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead . After the first Hamburg residency , the band accepted another in April 1961 , and a third in April 1962 . As with the other band members , Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg , and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long , overnight performances .	Why did you think Harrison was too young?	I thought Harrison was too young because he was only 14 years old at the time.
