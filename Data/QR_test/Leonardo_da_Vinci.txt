Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.	What are your areas of expertise?	I am skilled in painting, draughtsmanship, engineering, science, theory, sculpture, and architecture.

Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.	Where were you educated?	I was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio.

Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance. Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major works—including numerous unfinished works—he created some of the most influential paintings in Western art. His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo, was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.

Revered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.	What types of machines did you conceptualize?	I conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, and a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine.

Leonardo da Vinci,[b] properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (Leonardo, son of ser Piero from Vinci),[c] was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence.[d] He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero da Vinci d'Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426–1504), a Florentine legal notary, and Caterina di Meo Lippi (c. 1434 – 1494), from the lower-class.[e] It remains uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti, is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had.[a] Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his birth. Caterina—who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only "Caterina" or "Catelina"—is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed "L'Accattabriga", '"the quarrelsome one"'. Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori—having been betrothed to her the previous year—and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages.[f] From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy) who were much younger than he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old) and with whom he had very little contact.[g]	When and where were you born?	I was born on 15 April 1452 in or near the town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence.

Very little is known about Leonardo's childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of his biography in the frequently apocryphal Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1550) by the 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari. Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 he lived in the household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci, but it is possible that he spent the years before then in the care of his mother in Vinci, either Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San Pantaleone. He is thought to have been close to his uncle, Francesco da Vinci, but his father was probably in Florence most of the time. Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an official residence in Florence by at least 1469 and had a successful career. Despite his family history, Leonardo only received a basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading and mathematics, possibly because his artistic talents were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention there.	Where did you live with your grandfather?	Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 I lived in the household of my paternal grandfather, Antonio.

Later in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus. While writing on the flight of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth with its tail; commentators still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.	What did you record in the Codex Atlanticus?	I recorded my earliest memory in the Codex Atlanticus.

In the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Around the age of 14, he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time. This was about the time of the death of Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello.[h] Leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years. Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi. Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.[i]	Where did your family move to in the mid-1460s?

Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.[i]	Who was your mentor in your studio when you were a garzone?	My mentor in my studio when I was a garzone was Andrea del Verrocchio.
In the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Around the age of 14, he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time.

Leonardo was a contemporary of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino, who were all slightly older than he was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio or at the Platonic Academy of the Medici. Florence was ornamented by the works of artists such as Donatello's contemporaries Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Leon Battista Alberti's treatise De pictura were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.	Who were some of your contemporaries?	Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, and Perugino were some of my contemporaries.

Much of the painting in Verrocchio's workshop was done by his assistants. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again,[‡ 1] although this is believed to be an apocryphal story. Close examination reveals areas of the work that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera, using the new technique of oil paint, including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream, and much of the figure of Jesus, bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello, and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.	Did you collaborate with Verrocchio on The Baptism of Christ?	Yes, I did.

During his lifetime , Leonardo was also valued as an engineer . With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy , Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices . He drew their " anatomy " with unparalleled mastery , producing the first form of the modern technical drawing , including a perfected " exploded view " technique , to represent internal components . Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5 , 000 pages . In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro , he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege . When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499 , he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack . In 1502 , he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river , a project on which Niccol ò Machiavelli also worked . He continued to contemplate the canalization of Lombardy ' s plains while in Louis XII ' s company and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I . Leonardo ' s journals include a vast number of inventions , both practical and impractical . They include musical instruments , a mechanical knight , hydraulic pumps , reversible crank mechanisms , finned mortar shells , and a steam cannon .	How many pages did your studies and projects fill?	My studies and projects filled more than 5,000 pages.
The interest in Leonardo ' s genius has continued unabated ; experts study and translate his writings , analyse his paintings using scientific techniques , argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found . Liana Bortolon , writing in 1967 , said : " Because of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every field of knowledge ... Leonardo can be considered , quite rightly , to have been the universal genius par excellence , and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term . Man is as uncomfortable today , faced with a genius , as he was in the 16th century . Five centuries have passed , yet we still view Leonardo with awe . " The Elmer Belt Library of Vinciana is a special collection at the University of California , Los Angeles .	What are you analyzing using scientific techniques?	I am analyzing my paintings using scientific techniques.
Leonardo died at Clos Luc é on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67 , possibly of a stroke . Francis I had become a close friend . Vasari describes Leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed , full of repentance , that " he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done . " Vasari states that in his last days , Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament . [ ‡ 4 ] Vasari also records that the king held Leonardo ' s head in his arms as he died , although this story may be legend rather than fact . [ s ] [ t ] In accordance with his will , sixty beggars carrying tapers followed Leonardo ' s casket . [ u ] Melzi was the principal heir and executor , receiving , as well as money , Leonardo ' s paintings , tools , library and personal effects . Leonardo ' s other long - time pupil and companion , Sala ì , and his servant Baptista de Vilanis , each received half of Leonardo ' s vineyards . His brothers received land , and his serving woman received a fur - lined cloak . On 12 August 1519 , Leonardo ' s remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Ch â teau d ' Amboise .	Who had become a close friend of yours?	Francis I had become a close friend of mine.
In March 1513 , Lorenzo de ' Medici ' s son Giovanni assumed the papacy ( as Leo X ) ; Leonardo went to Rome that September , where he was received by the pope ' s brother Giuliano . From September 1513 to 1516 , Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace , where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active . Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month , and according to Vasari , decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver . The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter , but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish . [ o ] Leonardo became ill , in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death . He practiced botany in the Gardens of Vatican City , and was commissioned to make plans for the pope ' s proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes . He also dissected cadavers , making notes for a treatise on vocal cords ; these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the pope ' s favor , but was unsuccessful .

Renaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts , and Leonardo ' s studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work . These studies were recorded in 13 , 000 pages of notes and drawings , which fuse art and natural philosophy ( the forerunner of modern science ) . They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo ' s life and travels , as he made continual observations of the world around him . Leonardo ' s notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations , some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water . There are compositions for paintings , studies of details and drapery , studies of faces and emotions , of animals , babies , dissections , plant studies , rock formations , whirlpools , war machines , flying machines and architecture .	How are your studies in science and engineering described?	My studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as my artistic work.

Beyond friendship , Leonardo kept his private life secret . His sexuality has been the subject of satire , analysis , and speculation . This trend began in the mid - 16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries , most notably by Sigmund Freud in his Leonardo da Vinci , A Memory of His Childhood . Leonardo ' s most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Sala ì and Melzi . Melzi , writing to inform Leonardo ' s brothers of his death , described Leonardo ' s feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate . It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature . Court records of 1476 , when he was aged twenty - four , show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a well - known male prostitute . The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence , and there is speculation that since one of the accused , Lionardo de Tornabuoni , was related to Lorenzo de ' Medici , the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal . Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art , particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings .	What has been claimed about your relationships since the 16th century?	It has been claimed since the 16th century that my relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature.
Other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as " caricatures " because , although exaggerated , they appear to be based upon observation of live models . Vasari relates that Leonardo would look for interesting faces in public to use as models for some of his work . [ ‡ 7 ] There are numerous studies of beautiful young men , often associated with Sala ì , with the rare and much admired facial feature , the so - called " Grecian profile " . [ y ] These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior . Sala ì is often depicted in fancy - dress costume . Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated . Other , often meticulous , drawings show studies of drapery . A marked development in Leonardo ' s ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works . Another often - reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli , hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano , brother of Lorenzo de ' Medici , in the Pazzi conspiracy . In his notes , Leonardo recorded the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died .	What kind of development occurred in your ability to draw drapery?

In 1506 , Leonardo was summoned to Milan by Charles II d ' Amboise , the acting French governor of the city . There , Leonardo took on another pupil , Count Francesco Melzi , the son of a Lombard aristocrat , who is considered to have been his favourite student . The Council of Florence wished Leonardo to return promptly to finish The Battle of Anghiari , but he was given leave at the behest of Louis XII , who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits . Leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d ' Amboise ; a wax model survives and , if genuine , is the only extant example of Leonardo ' s sculpture . Leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests . Many of Leonardo ' s most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in Milan , including Bernardino Luini , Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio , and Marco d ' Oggiono . In 1507 , Leonardo was in Florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father , who had died in 1504 .	Who was your favorite student?	Count Francesco Melzi

Sala ì , or Il Salaino ( " The Little Unclean One " , i . e . , the devil ) , entered Leonardo ' s household in 1490 as an assistant . After only a year , Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours , calling him " a thief , a liar , stubborn , and a glutton , " after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes . Nevertheless , Leonardo treated him with great indulgence , and he remained in Leonardo ' s household for the next thirty years . Sala ì executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Sala ì , but although Vasari claims that Leonardo " taught him many things about painting , " [ ‡ 3 ] his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo ' s pupils , such as Marco d ' Oggiono and Boltraffio .

In October 1515 , King Francis I of France recaptured Milan . Leonardo was present at the 19 December meeting of Francis I and Leo X , which took place in Bologna . In 1516 , Leonardo entered Francis ' service , being given the use of the manor house Clos Luc é , near the king ' s residence at the royal Ch â teau d ' Amboise . Being frequently visited by Francis , he drew plans for an immense castle town the king intended to erect at Romorantin , and made a mechanical lion , which during a pageant walked toward the king and — upon being struck by a wand — opened its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies . [ ‡ 3 ] [ p ] Leonardo was accompanied during this time by his friend and apprentice Francesco Melzi , and supported by a pension totalling 10 , 000   scudi . At some point , Melzi drew a portrait of Leonardo ; the only others known from his lifetime were a sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of Leonardo ' s studies ( c .   1517 ) and a drawing by Giovanni Ambrogio Figino depicting an elderly Leonardo with his right arm wrapped in clothing .

In 1506 , Leonardo was summoned to Milan by Charles II d ' Amboise , the acting French governor of the city . There , Leonardo took on another pupil , Count Francesco Melzi , the son of a Lombard aristocrat , who is considered to have been his favourite student . The Council of Florence wished Leonardo to return promptly to finish The Battle of Anghiari , but he was given leave at the behest of Louis XII , who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits . Leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d ' Amboise ; a wax model survives and , if genuine , is the only extant example of Leonardo ' s sculpture . Leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests . Many of Leonardo ' s most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in Milan , including Bernardino Luini , Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio , and Marco d ' Oggiono . In 1507 , Leonardo was in Florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father , who had died in 1504 .	Who summoned you to Milan in 1506?	Charles II d'Amboise summoned me.
In March 1513 , Lorenzo de ' Medici ' s son Giovanni assumed the papacy ( as Leo X ) ; Leonardo went to Rome that September , where he was received by the pope ' s brother Giuliano . From September 1513 to 1516 , Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace , where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active . Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month , and according to Vasari , decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver . The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter , but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish . [ o ] Leonardo became ill , in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death . He practiced botany in the Gardens of Vatican City , and was commissioned to make plans for the pope ' s proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes . He also dissected cadavers , making notes for a treatise on vocal cords ; these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the pope ' s favor , but was unsuccessful .	How much allowance did you receive a month?	I was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month.
The interest in Leonardo ' s genius has continued unabated ; experts study and translate his writings , analyse his paintings using scientific techniques , argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found . Liana Bortolon , writing in 1967 , said : " Because of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every field of knowledge ... Leonardo can be considered , quite rightly , to have been the universal genius par excellence , and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term . Man is as uncomfortable today , faced with a genius , as he was in the 16th century . Five centuries have passed , yet we still view Leonardo with awe . " The Elmer Belt Library of Vinciana is a special collection at the University of California , Los Angeles .	What are you studying and translating?	I am studying and translating my writings.

To sort out a dispute with my brothers over my father's estate.
In October 1515 , King Francis I of France recaptured Milan . Leonardo was present at the 19 December meeting of Francis I and Leo X , which took place in Bologna . In 1516 , Leonardo entered Francis ' service , being given the use of the manor house Clos Luc é , near the king ' s residence at the royal Ch â teau d ' Amboise . Being frequently visited by Francis , he drew plans for an immense castle town the king intended to erect at Romorantin , and made a mechanical lion , which during a pageant walked toward the king and — upon being struck by a wand — opened its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies .

I drew plans for an immense castle town that the king intended to erect at Romorantin.
During his lifetime , Leonardo was also valued as an engineer . With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy , Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices . He drew their " anatomy " with unparalleled mastery , producing the first form of the modern technical drawing , including a perfected " exploded view " technique , to represent internal components . Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5 , 000 pages . In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro , he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege . When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499 , he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack . In 1502 , he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river , a project on which Niccol ò Machiavelli also worked . He continued to contemplate the canalization of Lombardy ' s plains while in Louis XII ' s company and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I . Leonardo ' s journals include a vast number of inventions , both practical and impractical . They include musical instruments , a mechanical knight , hydraulic pumps , reversible crank mechanisms , finned mortar shells , and a steam cannon .	How did you use your rational and analytical approach?	I used my rational and analytical approach to represent the human body, investigate anatomy, and design machines and devices.
