An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances.

After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record-extending seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, became the first player to score in every stage of a World Cup (including two in the final), and broke the record for most appearances in World Cup tournaments with 26 matches played.

Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.	When and where were you born?	I was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe.

Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.	How do you celebrate your goals?	I celebrate my goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to my grandmother.
A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they declined to pay for his treatment. His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".	When did you join Newell's Old Boys?	I joined Newell's Old Boys when I was six years old.

As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.	Why did your family seek to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000?	My family had relatives in Catalonia.

After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the "Baby Dream Team", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.	When did you join the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF)?	I joined the RFEF in February 2002.

During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."	How many goals did you score in the Juveniles A team?	I scored 18 goals in 11 league games for the Juveniles A team.

At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003. His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team. After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called "little brother", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.	When did you make your first team debut?

Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista , who had orchestrated Argentina ' s Olympic victory . Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi , employing him as a false nine within a 4 – 3 – 3 system , as used to much success by Barcelona . Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010 – 11 club season , he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009 . Despite the tactical change , his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa Am é rica , hosted by Argentina . Their first two matches , against Bolivia and Colombia , ended in draws . Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez , who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public ; Messi was consequently booed by his own team ' s supporters for the first time in his career . During the crucial next match , with Tevez on the bench , he gave a well - received performance , assisting two goals in their 3 – 0 victory over Costa Rica . After the quarter - final against Uruguay ended in a 1 – 1 draw following extra time , with Messi having assisted their equaliser , Argentina were eliminated 4 – 5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions .	Who did you have difficulty combining well with on the field during the Copa América?	Carlos Tevez
On 4 March , he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1 – 0 home win over Atl é tico Madrid , in La Liga . On 14 March , Messi scored his 99th and 100th Champions League goals in a 3 – 0 home win over Chelsea , becoming only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this landmark , in fewer appearances , at a younger age and having taken fewer shots than his Portuguese counterpart . His opening goal , which came after only two minutes and eight seconds , was also the fastest of his career , as Barcelona advanced to the quarter - finals of the competition for the eleventh consecutive season . On 7 April , he scored a hat - trick in a 3 – 1 win over Legan é s including his sixth goal scored from a free - kick for the season , matching the record set by former teammate Ronaldinho . He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga , with 34 goals , which also saw him win his fifth Golden Shoe award . On 21 April , Messi scored Barcelona ' s second goal – his 40th of the season – in a 5 – 0 win over Sevilla in the 2018 Copa del Rey final , later also setting up Su á rez ' s second goal ; this was Barcelona ' s fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall . On 29 April , Messi scored a hat - trick in a 4 – 2 away win over Deportivo de La Coru ñ a , which saw Barcelona claim their 25th league title . On 9 May , Messi scored as Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5 – 1 to set the longest unbeaten streak ( 43 games ) in La Liga history .	Who was the first player to reach 100 Champions League goals?	Cristiano Ronaldo was the first player to reach 100 Champions League goals.
Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013 , eventually equalling Real Madrid ' s 100 - point record of the previous season . However , their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012 – 13 campaign , concurrently with Vilanova ' s absence due to ill health . After losing successive Cl á sicos , including the Copa del Rey semi - finals , they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan , but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4 – 0 comeback , with two goals and an assist from Messi . Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona , Messi signed a new contract on 7 February , committing himself to the club through 2018 , while his fixed wage rose to € 13   million . He wore the captain ' s armband for the first time a month later , on 17 March , in a league match against Rayo Vallecano ; by then , he had become the team ' s tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier , L á szl ó Kubala and Johan Cruyff . Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier , his input into the team ' s attack had increased ; from 24% in their treble - winning campaign , his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season .	How did Barcelona perform in the first knockout round of the Champions League against AC Milan?	Barcelona were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan.

Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010 – 11 club season , he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009 . Despite the tactical change , his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa Am é rica , hosted by Argentina . Their first two matches , against Bolivia and Colombia , ended in draws . Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez , who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public ; Messi was consequently booed by his own team ' s supporters for the first time in his career . During the crucial next match , with Tevez on the bench , he gave a well - received performance , assisting two goals in their 3 – 0 victory over Costa Rica . After the quarter - final against Uruguay ended in a 1 – 1 draw following extra time , with Messi having assisted their equaliser , Argentina were eliminated 4 – 5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions .	What tactics did you intend to use for the team?	I intended to employ a 4 – 3 – 3 system, with Messi as a false nine.

At the semi - final stage , Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side ' s 6 – 1 victory over Paraguay , receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd . Argentina started the final as the odds - on title favourites , but were defeated by Chile 4 – 1 in a penalty shootout after a 0 – 0 extra - time draw . Faced with aggression from opposing players , including taking a boot to the midriff , Messi played below his standards , though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty . At the close of the tournament , he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour . As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993 , the World Cup and Copa Am é rica defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans .
