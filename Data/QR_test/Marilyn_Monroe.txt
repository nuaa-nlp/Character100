By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal , Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger , in contrast to the 1940s femme fatales . Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of " the postwar ideal of the American girl , soft , transparently needy , worshipful of men , na ï ve , offering sex without demands " , which is echoed in Molly Haskell ' s statement that " she was the Fifties fiction , the lie that a woman had no sexual needs , that she is there to cater to , or enhance , a man ' s needs . " Monroe ' s contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that " Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others , but ice cream with her " , while Groucho Marx characterized her as " Mae West , Theda Bara , and Bo Peep all rolled into one " . According to Haskell , due to her sex symbol status , Monroe was less popular with women than with men , as they " couldn ' t identify with her and didn ' t support her " , although this would change after her death .
