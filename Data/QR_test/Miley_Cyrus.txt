Out of six siblings, as she has three brothers and two sisters, Cyrus is the second daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. She emerged as a teen idol while portraying the title character of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006–2011). As Hannah Montana, she attained two number-one and three top-five soundtracks on the Billboard 200, and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single "He Could Be the One". Cyrus' initial solo career consisted of the teen-friendly pop rock U.S. number-one albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007) and Breakout (2008); these releases contained the US top-ten singles "See You Again" and "7 Things". She then released the extended play The Time of Our Lives (2009), which peaked at number two in the U.S; its lead single, "Party in the U.S.A", became one of the best-selling singles in the United States and was certified diamond by the RIAA. She also released the country pop ballad "The Climb", which peaked at number four. Trying to reinvent her image, Cyrus explored dance-pop in her third album, Can't Be Tamed (2010). The record was critically panned; however, its title track reached the top ten in the U.S. Following a hiatus, she underwent a more mature and provocative musical shift with the release of the R&B and hip hop-infused Bangerz (2013). Supported by the top-five single "We Can't Stop" and the chart-topping "Wrecking Ball", it became her fifth number-one album and earned Cyrus her first Grammy Award nomination. She experimented with psychedelic music on her follow-up, the free album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), before exploring country pop on Younger Now (2017), which contained the U.S. top-ten single "Malibu", and trap on the EP She Is Coming (2019). Plastic Hearts (2020) saw Cyrus venture into rock and glam rock; the record became her first number-one entry on the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart. In 2021, Cyrus collaborated with The Kid Laroi on a remix of his single, "Without You". Cyrus' eighth studio album, Endless Summer Vacation (2023), was preceded by the lead single "Flowers", which set several streaming records and became her second U.S. number-one single.	How many siblings do you have?	Out of six siblings, I have three brothers and two sisters.
