Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.	Where were you born?

In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 25 films since.

In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (later known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, at the age of 56, with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of Apple. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.	Who was largely responsible for reviving Apple in 1997?

Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs was the son of a dairy farmer; after dropping out of high school, he worked as a mechanic, then joined the U.S. Coast Guard. When his ship was decommissioned, he met Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian descent, and the two were engaged ten days later, in March 1946, and married that same year. The couple moved to Wisconsin, then Indiana, where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman. Since Clara missed San Francisco, she convinced Paul to move back. There, Paul worked as a repossession agent, and Clara became a bookkeeper. In 1955, after having an ectopic pregnancy, the couple looked to adopt a child. Since they lacked a college education, Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers, and went to court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family, but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their son's college tuition.

In his youth, Jobs' parents took him to a Lutheran church. When he was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life … I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware, and later said he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later, Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents".[page needed] Jobs would "bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his "adoptive parents", and he regarded them as his parents "1,000%". Jobs referred to his biological parents as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."	Who took you to a Lutheran church in your youth?	My parents took me to a Lutheran church.

As Jobs became more successful with his new company , his relationship with Brennan grew more complex . In 1977 , the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship , and Brennan , Daniel Kottke , and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino . [ citation needed ] Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple . Brennan ' s relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his position with Apple grew , and she began to consider ending the relationship . In October 1977 , Brennan was approached by Rod Holt , who asked her to take " a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples " . [ citation needed ] Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for her , given her artistic abilities . Holt was particularly eager that she take the position , and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it . Brennan ' s decision , however , was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant , and that Jobs was the father . It took her a few days to tell Jobs , whose face , according to Brennan , " turned ugly " at the news . At the same time , according to Brennan , at the beginning of her third trimester , Jobs said to her : " I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion . I just didn ' t want to do that . " [ citation needed ] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her . Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple . She stated that Jobs told her " If you give up this baby for adoption , you will be sorry " and " I am never going to help you " . [ citation needed ] According to Brennan , Jobs " started to seed people with the notion that I slept around , and he was infertile , which meant that this could not be his child " . A few weeks before she was due to give birth , Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm . She accepted the offer . [ citation needed ] When Jobs was 23 ( the same age as his biological parents when they had him ) Brennan gave birth to her baby , Lisa Brennan , on May 17 , 1978 . Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland , their mutual friend and the farm owner . While distant , Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby , which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket . Brennan suggested the name " Lisa " which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name " Lisa " while he " was also publicly denying paternity " . She would discover later that during this time , Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name ( his first choice was " Claire " after St . Clare ) . She stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby ' s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her . Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase , " Local Integrated Software Architecture " as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa . Decades later , however , Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that " obviously , it was named for my daughter " .	Who approached you with a job offer related to Apple?	Rod Holt approached me with a job offer related to Apple.
