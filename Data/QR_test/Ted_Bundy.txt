Bundy was often regarded as charismatic and handsome, traits he exploited to win the trust of both his victims and society as a whole. He typically approached women in public places, either asking for help by feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure. Once tricked into being led away, they would be bludgeoned unconscious and taken elsewhere to be sexually assaulted and killed. Bundy frequently revisited the bodies of those he abducted, grooming and performing sex acts on the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.	How do you typically approach women?	I typically approach women in public places, either asking for help by feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure.

What did you do once you tricked the women into being led away?	Once I tricked the women into being led away, I would bludgeon them unconscious and take them elsewhere to be sexually assaulted and killed.

Biographer Ann Rule characterized him as "a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death and even after." Bundy once described himself as "the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet," a statement with which attorney Polly Nelson, a member of his last defense team, agreed. "Ted," she wrote, "was the very definition of heartless evil."	How did Ann Rule characterize you?

Ted Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (September 21, 1924 – December 23, 2012, known by her middle name) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers in Burlington, Vermont. His biological father's identity has never been confirmed; his original birth certificate apparently assigns paternity to a salesman and United States Air Force veteran named Lloyd Marshall, though a copy of it listed his father as unknown. Louise claimed she met a war veteran named Jack Worthington, who abandoned her soon after she became pregnant. Census records reveal that several men by the name of "John Worthington" and "Lloyd Marshall" lived near Louise when Bundy was conceived. Some family members expressed suspicions that Bundy might have been fathered by Louise's own father. In the 2020 documentary film Crazy, Not Insane, psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis claimed she received a sample of Bundy's blood—though she did not specify from where—and had arranged a DNA test which confirmed that Bundy was not the product of incest.	When and where were you born?	I was born on November 24, 1946, at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers in Burlington, Vermont.

For the first three years of his life, Bundy lived in the Philadelphia neighborhood Roxborough with his maternal grandparents, Samuel Knecht Cowell (September 23, 1898 – December 4, 1983) and Eleanor Miriam Cowell née Longstreet (February 16, 1895 – April 25, 1971) who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock at that time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Bundy eventually discovered the truth, although his recollections of the circumstances varied; he told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a "bastard," but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he had found the certificate himself. Biographer and true crime writer Ann Rule, who knew Bundy personally, wrote that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont. Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.	Where did you live for the first three years of your life?	I lived in the Philadelphia neighborhood Roxborough with my maternal grandparents.

How did you find out the truth about your parentage?	According to different accounts, I either had a cousin show me a copy of my birth certificate or I found the certificate myself.
Bundy occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior at an early age. Louise's younger sister Julia recalled awakening from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the kitchen, and three-year-old Ted standing by the bed, smiling. Bundy's childhood neighbor Sandi Holt described him as a bully, saying, "He liked to terrify people... He liked to be in charge. He liked to inflict pain and suffering and fear."

In some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents and told Rule that he "identified with," "respected," and "clung to" his grandfather. In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel was a tyrannical bully who beat his wife and dog, exhibited bigotry (including religious intolerance, racism, and xenophobia), and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. In one instance, Samuel threw Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping. He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences, and at least once flew into a violent rage when the question of Bundy's paternity was raised. Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life. These descriptions of Bundy's grandparents have been questioned in more recent investigations. Some locals remembered Cowell as a "fine man", if a bit eccentric, and expressed bewilderment at the reports of him being violent. A cousin of Bundy claimed that the negative characterizations of Cowell likely arose to explain how his grandson became a serial killer. In addition, Louise's sister Audrey stated that their mother could not leave her home because she suffered a stroke due to being overweight and was not mentally ill.	How do you describe your relationship with your grandparents?	I speak warmly of my grandparents and say that I "identify with," "respect," and "cling to" my grandfather.

In 1950, Louise changed her surname from Cowell to Nelson and, at the urging of multiple family members, left Philadelphia with Ted to live with cousins Alan and Jane Scott in Tacoma, Washington. In 1951 she met Johnny Culpepper Bundy (April 23, 1921 – May 17, 2007), a hospital cook, at an adult singles night at Tacoma's First Methodist Church. They married later that year and Johnny formally adopted Ted. Johnny and Louise conceived four children together, and though Johnny tried to include his adopted son in camping trips and other family activities, Ted remained distant from him. He would later complain to a girlfriend that Johnny "was not his real father", "wasn't very bright," and "didn't make much money."	What was Louise's original surname?	Cowell.

They married later that year and Johnny formally adopted Ted. Johnny and Louise conceived four children together, and though Johnny tried to include his adopted son in camping trips and other family activities, Ted remained distant from him. He would later complain to a girlfriend that Johnny "was not his real father", "wasn't very bright," and "didn't make much money."	Who did you leave Philadelphia with in 1950?	Me.

Bundy varied his recollections of Tacoma in later years. To Michaud and Aynesworth, he described roaming his neighborhood, picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women  and to attorney and author Polly Nelson he said that he perused detective magazines, crime novels, and true crime documentaries for stories that involved sexual violence, particularly when the stories were illustrated with pictures of dead or maimed women. In a letter to Rule, however, he asserted that he "never, ever read fact-detective magazines, and shuddered at the thought that anyone would." He told Michaud that he would consume large quantities of alcohol and "canvass the community" late at night in search of undraped windows where he could observe women undressing, or "whatever [else] could be seen."	What did you describe to Michaud and Aynesworth about your activities in Tacoma?	I described roaming my neighborhood and picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women.

According to Mike Minerva , a Tallahassee public defender and member of the defense team , a pre - trial plea bargain was negotiated in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy , Bowman , and Leach in exchange for a firm 75 - year prison sentence . Prosecutors were amenable to a deal , by one account , because " prospects of losing at trial were very good . " Bundy , on the other hand , saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty , but also as a " tactical move " : he could enter his plea , then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die , move on , or retract their testimony . Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair , he could file a post - conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal . At the last minute , however , Bundy refused the deal . " It made him realize he was going to have to stand up in front of the whole world and say he was guilty " , Minerva said . " He just couldn ' t do it . "	Who was involved in negotiating the pre-trial plea bargain?	Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee public defender and member of the defense team.
On August 16 , 1975 , Bundy was arrested by Utah Highway Patrol officer Bob Hayward in Granger , another Salt Lake City suburb . Hayward observed Bundy cruising a residential area in his Volkswagen Beetle during the pre - dawn hours , and fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car . He noticed that the Volkswagen ' s front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats , and searched the car . He found a ski mask , a second mask fashioned from pantyhose , a crowbar , handcuffs , trash bags , a coil of rope , an ice pick , and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools . Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing , he had found the handcuffs in a dumpster , and the rest were common household items . However , Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping , and Bundy ' s name from Kloepfer ' s phone call a month later . In a search of Bundy ' s apartment , police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn , and a brochure that advertised the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful , where Kent had disappeared . The police did not have sufficient evidence to detain Bundy , so he was released on his own recognizance . Bundy later said that searchers missed a hidden collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims , which he destroyed after he was released .	Why did you explain that you had a ski mask?	I said it was for skiing
Rule and Aynesworth both noted that for Bundy , the fault always lay with someone or something else . While he eventually confessed to thirty murders , he never accepted responsibility for any of them , even when offered that opportunity prior to the Chi Omega trial , which would have spared him the death penalty . He deflected blame onto a wide variety of scapegoats , including his abusive grandfather , the absence of his biological father , the concealment of his true parentage by his mother , alcohol , the media , the police ( whom he accused of planting evidence ) , society in general , violence on television , and , ultimately , true crime periodicals and pornography . He blamed television programming , which he watched mostly on sets that he had stolen , for " brainwashing " him into stealing credit cards . On at least one occasion , he even tried to blame his victims : " I have known people who ... radiate vulnerability " , he wrote in a 1977 letter to Kloepfer . " Their facial expressions say ' I am afraid of you . ' These people invite abuse ... By expecting to be hurt , do they subtly encourage it ? "	Who did you try to blame on at least one occasion?	I tried to blame my victims, stating that some people radiate vulnerability and by expecting to be hurt, they subtly encourage abuse.
In early 1986 , an execution date ( March 4 ) was set on the Chi Omega convictions ; the U . S . Supreme Court issued a brief stay , but the execution was quickly rescheduled . In April , shortly after the new date ( July 2 ) was announced , Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was the full range of his depredations , including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths . He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain , Issaquah , and other secondary crime scenes , often several times , to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop . In some cases , he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night . In Utah , he applied makeup to Smith ' s lifeless face , and repeatedly washed Aime ' s hair . " If you ' ve got time , " he told Hagmaier , " they can be anything you want them to be . " He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw , and kept at least one group of severed heads — probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain ( Rancourt , Parks , Ball and Healy ) — in his apartment for a period of time before disposing of them .	When was your new execution date announced?	My new execution date of July 2 was announced in April.

In January 1974 , Bundy abruptly broke off all contact with Edwards ; her phone calls and letters went unreturned . When she finally reached him by phone a month later , she demanded to know why he had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation . In a flat , calm voice , he replied , " Diane , I have no idea what you mean , " and hung up . She never heard from him again . Bundy later explained , " I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her " ; but Edwards concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance , as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968 . By then , Bundy had begun skipping classes at law school . By April he had stopped attending entirely , as young women began to disappear in the Pacific Northwest .	What was your response when Edwards asked why you ended our relationship?	"Diane, I have no idea what you mean," I replied in a flat, calm voice and hung up.

Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24 - hour surveillance , and Thompson flew to Seattle with two other detectives to interview Kloepfer . She told them that in the year prior to Bundy ' s move to Utah , she had discovered objects that she " couldn ' t understand " in her house and in Bundy ' s apartment . These items included crutches , a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house , and a meat cleaver that was never used for cooking . Additional objects included surgical gloves , an Oriental knife in a wooden case that he kept in his glove compartment , and a sack full of women ' s clothing . Bundy was perpetually in debt , and Kloepfer suspected that he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he possessed . When she confronted him over a new TV and stereo , he warned her , " If you tell anyone , I ' ll break your fucking neck . " She said Bundy became " very upset " whenever she considered cutting her hair , which was long and parted in the middle . She would sometimes awaken in the middle of the night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight , examining her body . He kept a lug wrench , taped halfway up the handle , in the trunk of her car — another Volkswagen Beetle , which he often borrowed — " for protection " . The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished , nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted from Lake Sammamish State Park . Shortly thereafter , Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney , and learned of the existence of Diane Edwards and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973 .	What did you discover in your house and in my apartment?	I discovered objects that I couldn't understand, including crutches, a bag of plaster of Paris, a meat cleaver, surgical gloves, an Oriental knife, and a sack full of women's clothing.

In mid - 1970 , Bundy , now focused and goal - oriented , re - enrolled at UW , this time as a psychology major . He became an honor student and was well regarded by his professors . In 1971 , he took a job at Seattle ' s Suicide Hotline Crisis Center . There , he met and worked alongside Ann Rule , a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive Bundy biographies , The Stranger Beside Me . Rule saw nothing disturbing in Bundy ' s personality at the time ; she described him as " kind , solicitous , and empathetic . "	What kind of student were you at UW?	I was an honor student and was well-regarded by my professors at UW.

How did you react when I finally reached you by phone?	I demanded to know why you had ended our relationship without explanation.
On February 12 , with insufficient cash to pay his overdue rent and a growing suspicion that police were closing in on him , Bundy stole a car and fled Tallahassee , driving westward across the Florida Panhandle . Three days later , at around 1 : 00   a . m . , he was stopped by Pensacola police officer David Lee near the Alabama state line after a " wants and warrants " check showed his Volkswagen Beetle was stolen . When told he was under arrest , Bundy kicked Lee ' s legs out from under him and took off running . Lee fired two warning shots , then gave chase and tackled him . The two struggled over Lee ' s gun before the officer finally subdued and arrested Bundy . In the stolen vehicle were three sets of IDs belonging to female FSU students , 21 stolen credit cards and a stolen television set . Also found were a pair of dark - rimmed non - prescription glasses and a pair of plaid slacks , later identified as the disguise worn by " Richard Burton , Fire Department " in Jacksonville . As Lee transported his suspect to jail , unaware that he had just arrested one of the FBI ' s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives , he heard Bundy say , " I wish you had killed me . "	What did you do when you were told you were under arrest?	When told I was under arrest, I kicked Lee's legs out from under him and took off running.

Who did you confess to?	I confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson.
While experts found Bundy ' s precise diagnosis elusive , the majority of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses , and toward antisocial personality disorder ( ASPD ) . Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients ( who are often identified as " sociopaths " or " psychopaths " ) , such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade ; the ability to distinguish right from wrong , but with minimal effect on behavior ; and an absence of guilt or remorse . " Guilt doesn ' t solve anything , really " , Bundy said , in 1981 . " It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not having to deal with guilt . " There was also evidence of narcissism , poor judgment , and manipulative behavior . Upon assessment using the Psychopathy Checklist – revised ( PCL - R ) , Bundy was reportedly evaluated as 39 / 40 . Prosecutor George Dekle wrote , " Sociopaths are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody . " " Sometimes he manipulates even me " , admitted one psychiatrist . In the end , Lewis agreed with the majority : " I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real , true psychopath , I ' ll buy them dinner " , she told Nelson . " I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one , a true psychopath , without any remorse or empathy at all . " Narcissistic personality disorder ( NPD ) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis .	What evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses as a diagnosis for you?	The majority of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses.
