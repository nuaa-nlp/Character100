Calaway began training under Buzz Sawyer in late 1986; he disliked Sawyer, who reportedly lacked commitment and provided a limited education. Calaway learned "on the job" thereafter. Performing under a mask as Texas Red, Calaway wrestled his first match on June 26, 1987, for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), losing to Bruiser Brody at the Dallas Sportatorium. He was accompanied to the ring by Percival "Percy" Pringle III, who would later serve as his manager in the WWF as Paul Bearer. Two myths have circulated regarding Calaway's beginnings in the industry, the first being that he made his in-ring debut in 1984, and the second being that he was trained by former WCCW colleague Don Jardine (aka The Spoiler). While never trained by Jardine, Calaway was an admirer of his work and would emulate Jardine's top rope walk. PWInsider's Mike Johnson stated, "Undertaker using some of Jardine's style eventually morphed into this story that he was trained by Jardine." He wreslted in Durban South Africa losing to Tiger Singh on August 22, 1987.	When did you have your first match?	I wrestled my first match on June 26, 1987.

In the storyline leading up to WrestleMania XX , Kane was tormented by horror - themed mind games , paranormal activities , and spooking vignettes proclaiming The Undertaker ' s Deadman return . The first was during the Royal Rumble when The Undertaker ' s bells tolled , distracting Kane and allowing Booker T to eliminate him . Accompanied by Paul Bearer at WrestleMania XX , The Undertaker resurrected his Deadman identity , defeating Kane in a singles match . Introduced was a more dramatic , theatrical and supernatural Deadman than in years past , his presence , mannerisms , and entrances significantly elaborated on as well , such as with more intensity , special effects and rising and falling flames . At the same time , The Undertaker maintained elements of his American Badass identity , thus a composite character more humanized than all of his previous Deadman incarnations ( Undertaker would present in this particular hybrid Deadman form until No Mercy 2005 when Randy Orton sealed him in a casket and set it on fire ) . At Judgment Day , The Undertaker defeated Booker T . One week later , Paul Heyman ordered The Dudley Boyz to kidnap Bearer . Thus , Heyman " took control " of Undertaker . At The Great American Bash , Undertaker fought a handicap match against The Dudley Boyz , with the stipulation that if he did not lay down and purposely lose , Heyman would bury Paul Bearer in cement . The Undertaker won and stopped Heyman from burying Bearer , but after claiming Bearer was merely a liability he had no use for , buried him himself .	Who ordered The Dudley Boyz to kidnap Paul Bearer?	Paul Heyman.
In spite of Bearer projecting himself as a constant source of mental distress to The Undertaker during his Championship title reign , The Undertaker managed to secure successful title defenses against Stone Cold Steve Austin ( A Cold Day In Hell : In Your House ) , Faarooq ( King of the Ring ) and Vader ( Canadian Stampede : In Your House , revisiting and settling their Royal Rumble feud from earlier on in the year ) , respectively . Concurrent to the " deep , dark secret " storyline directed by Bearer , Undertaker began a then new rivalry at SummerSlam when special guest referee Shawn Michaels accidentally hit him with a steel chair shot intended for his archnemesis Bret Hart , in effect , costing The Undertaker the WWF Championship . The accidental chair shot led to Michaels feeling betrayed by the now booing WWF fans , and quickly becoming heel . Thus , a severely violent storyline with The Undertaker followed , one revolving around repeated intentional chair shots by Michaels on The Undertaker , Michaels taunting The Undertaker throughout . After the duo ' s very first match , which was a chaotic and uncontrolled encounter that resulted in a double count - out draw at Ground Zero : In Your House , Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first ever Hell in a Cell match to take place at Badd Blood : In Your House . Despite the inclusion of the cell for more order and to prevent Michaels from receiving help from his D - Generation X stable , the encounter ended up even more uncontrolled and savage than their first and is considered among one of The Undertaker ' s best matches of his career . Seemingly about to emerge the victor after striking Michaels with a chair shot of his own , The Undertaker was interrupted by his storyline half - brother Kane , finally making his debut . Under the control of Paul Bearer , Kane stormed the arena , ripped off the cell door , and laid out a nonplussed Undertaker with his own trademarked finisher , The Tombstone Piledriver , allowing Michaels to pin him for the victory . As the storyline progressed through Bearer having Kane mow down much of the WWF roster , Kane repeatedly challenged The Undertaker , going to lengths of tormenting and humiliating him . However , The Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half - brother , claiming he had made a vow to his parents never to do harm to his own " flesh and blood " . The Undertaker ' s final encounter with Michaels during this chapter of his career was in a casket match for the WWF Championship at the Royal Rumble . The week before on Raw , Kane had duplicitously presented as allying with his brother against Michaels ' s D - Generation X stable ; however , at the Royal Rumble , Kane trapped The Undertaker in the coffin , padlocked the lid shut , and set the casket ablaze , allowing Michaels another victory . After a two - month hiatus in which Kane wreaked havoc over the WWF , The Undertaker returned on the March 2 , 1998 , edition of Raw in a most notable resurrection — his druids interrupting Kane and Bearer by presenting them with a coffin on the entrance stage amid a large number of bell tolls . The coffin was struck and dismantled by a lightning bolt , revealing a lied out Undertaker who sat up in a fury state and challenged Kane to do battle with him . At WrestleMania XIV in their first match , The Undertaker defeated Kane . Kane challenged Undertaker to a rematch — Kane ' s specialty and first ever Inferno match — that occurred one month later at Unforgiven : In Your House . The Undertaker won the encounter by setting Kane ' s right arm on fire .	What type of match did you challenge Shawn Michaels to?	The first ever Hell in a Cell match.
After being buried alive and a following month - long hiatus , The Undertaker returned at the Survivor Series again pitting him against Mankind , but with a unique stipulation : Hanging 6.1   m ( 20   ft ) above the ring would be Paul Bearer , enclosed in a steel cage . And if The Undertaker were to win the match , he would be rewarded the opportunity to assault Bearer however he pleased . Even though The Undertaker won this match , interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape Undertaker ' s clutches . It was also at this event that The Undertaker had developed a comparatively more humanized and more informal yet still superhuman " Deadman " incarnation . In this then new form , he took on a Goth appearance and persona , with a brash , rebelling , Championship - driven mean streak ( perhaps to better fit in with the then - budding , more adult - oriented Attitude Era ) . This delivering , dubbed " The Lord of Darkness " , was the 3rd incarnation of his Deadman persona . Following Survivor Series , The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner , who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival . At In Your House 12 : It ' s Time , The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match even with Mankind heavily involved throughout the entire encounter . The Undertaker then moved on to feud with Vader , whom he faced in January 1997 at the Royal Rumble in a singles match , which The Undertaker lost after Bearer interfered on behalf of his new prot é g é . The two then clashed in the Royal Rumble match itself as they made it to the final moments of the match , but both were eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin , who had crept back into the match after his elimination was unseen . He faced both Vader and Austin in a four - corners elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at In Your House 13 : Final Four , but Bret Hart won . However , the following month , The Undertaker managed to win the WWF Championship for the second time by defeating Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13 . Reviving his first Deadman incarnation for that night only , The Undertaker appeared as the " Old West Mortician " , donning the trademarked gray wrestling gear accessories ( boot spats , tie , gloves ) , along with a pitch - black entrance with only a white spotlight shined over him , contrasted from the purple / blue semidarkness associated with the rest of his Deadman incarnations .	How did you win the WWF Championship for the second time?	By defeating Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13.
After the buildup to his second heel run in the latter part of 1998 , The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 — a dark priest - like character who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness . In this form , he took on a wicked , demonic presence , much more so than ever before . He often proclaimed to be invoking and taking orders from a " Higher Power " . Moreover , he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne with a towering backrest specially designed into his crucifix - like logo . With the help of his minions , he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers , using various incantations and magic words with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry . The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of The Brood ( Christian , Edge and Gangrel ) , The Acolytes ( Bradshaw and Faarooq ) , Mideon and Viscera . Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period , having undergone a hip replacement . As part of the angle , Undertaker had his Ministry members fight his battles , carry out his evil wishes and do all his dirty deeds . In this manner , he expressed his desires to take over the World Wrestling Federation , displacing its owner , Mr . McMahon . These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and The Corporation , ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer , Big Boss Man . The two faced off in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania XV , which Undertaker won . At Backlash : In Your House , Undertaker defeated Corporation member Ken Shamrock after interference from Ministry member Bradshaw .	Who did you face in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania XV?	Big Boss Man.

In February 1992 , The Undertaker ' s ally Jake " The Snake " Roberts tried to attack " Macho Man " Randy Savage ' s manager / wife Miss Elizabeth with a steel chair when Undertaker stopped him , turning him ( and Paul Bearer ) face for the first time . Their face turn was solidified on the February 29 edition of Superstars when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the Funeral Parlor set over the matter ( aired on Saturday Night ' s Main Event XXX ) . After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply , " Not yours " , Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker , only for The Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off . The Undertaker defeated Roberts at WrestleMania VIII . He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by Harvey Wippleman throughout 1992 and 1993 , such as Kamala and Giant Gonz á lez . Also during this time , The Undertaker headlined the first ever episode of Monday Night Raw on January 11 , 1993 , with a victory over Damien Demento . According to Calaway , working with Gonz á lez " ... was survival every night trying to figure out what he could do " and " took years off my career " . He faced Gonz á lez at WrestleMania IX , which is notable as The Undertaker ' s only disqualification win at WrestleMania after the use of chloroform . The Undertaker ' s next rivalry initiated at Survivor Series with Yokozuna when a clash between the two lost control , causing them to be counted out in an elimination tag match . In the weeks following , The Undertaker and Bearer spooked Yokozuna with multiple segments from their wintery and remote rural area workshop . There , Bearer presented The Undertaker hard at work carpentering Yokozuna what would eventually become a " double wide , double deep casket " custom - built for Yokozuna ' s immensely overweight size . The feud culminated in a WWF Championship casket match at the Royal Rumble in January 1994 . During the match , Yokozuna sealed The Undertaker in the casket with the assistance of a multitude of heel wrestlers ( some of them Whippleman - managed ) hired by Yokozuna ' s vindictive managers Jim Cornette and Mr . Fuji , which was in retaliation for Bearer ' s casket match stipulation that he snuck into their Royal Rumble match contract . After being trapped inside the casket by the pack , green vapor emitted from the casket and the arena lights went out . Undertaker then appeared from inside the casket on the video screen , representing the spirit of his dead corpse , warning that he would produce a future " rebirth " of himself , explaining to his antagonists that he cannot and will not Rest in Peace .

The Undertaker returned at Super ShowDown in Saudi Arabia on February 27 , 2020 , as a surprise replacement in a gauntlet match . He entered the match last , replacing Rey Mysterio and defeating AJ Styles to win the Tuwaiq Mountain Trophy . At Elimination Chamber during a natch between Styles and Aleister Black , Undertaker made another surprise appearance with an attack on Styles . The following night on Raw , Styles challenged Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 36 . Over the following weeks that led up to WrestleMania , a resentful Styles made unprecedented efforts to expose Undertaker , going so far as departing from bashing his Deadman gimmick , instead taking to a metafiction form of bashing Calaway himself . The feud saw Styles solely referring to Undertaker by his real name , Mark Calaway , referencing his age and his wife , Michelle McCool . In response , Undertaker cut promos of ominous warning against Styles in which for the first time in years , he broke from the Deadman gimmick by presenting as himself out of character . In doing so , elements of his American Badass gimmick were reflected with Calaway making appearances in his biker gear . At WrestleMania 36 , Undertaker presented his third and final identity , " The Unholy Trinity , " a combination of The Deadman , American Badass , and himself as Mark Calaway , this blend allowing him to trash talk Styles over real life matters during their encounter , while also able to maintain his superhuman horror capabilities . In what was subsequently learned to be Undertaker ' s final match , he and Styles fought in a cemetery at a secluded rural locale , competing in what was a cinematic , narrative - heavy brawl similar to " Buried Alive matches " , named the " Boneyard match " . Despite the assistance of Gallows and Anderson , The Undertaker buried Styles in the grave to win this match and ride off on motorcycle into the sunset , scoring his 25th WrestleMania victory to complete his professional wrestling career .	Who did you challenge to a match at WrestleMania 36?	I challenged Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 36.
Seeking retribution , The Undertaker revisited his feud with Yokozuna and eventually faced him in a casket rematch at Survivor Series . Chuck Norris ( portraying his Walker , Texas Ranger persona ) was involved in the match as special guest enforcer , preventing interference from wrestlers that Yokozuna , Jim Cornette and Mr . Fuji had again enlisted for help . Unable to rely on much as far as interference this time around ( only Irwin R . Schyster able to get in a brief ambush ) due to Norris averting the attempts of several heel wrestlers , Yokozuna was defeated by The Undertaker and sealed in the casket . Throughout most of 1995 , Undertaker feuded with members of Ted DiBiase ' s Million Dollar Corporation . The chain of wrestlers DiBiase enlisted to do away with The Undertaker started with Irwin R . Schyster at the Royal Rumble for which The Undertaker was victorious , but assaulted by another member of the Million Dollar Team , King Kong Bundy . In the process of being assaulted , Bearer was deprived of his urn by the Corporation . At WrestleMania XI , The Undertaker made short work of Bundy in a singles match . This edition of WrestleMania is noteworthy in that it produced the first mention of The Undertaker ' s historic WrestleMania - winning Streak , acknowledged on commentary by Vince McMahon as Undertaker made his entrance : " The Undertaker , on his way to the ring — a man who ' s never lost at WrestleMania . " During The Undertaker ' s WrestleMania encounter , DiBiase issued him with yet another antagonist in " The Supreme Fighting Machine " Kama , who had stolen the briefly recaptured urn from Bearer during the match . Kama followed this up with a series of malicious acts , including destroying the stolen urn and recycling it into bling . While sporting the flashy bling around his neck , he repeatedly cost The Undertaker matches and attacked diehard Undertaker fans , dubbed " Creatures of the Night " . In August , Undertaker settled the score with Kama , defeating him in a casket match at SummerSlam . Several weeks later , Undertaker suffered a serious orbital bone injury when King Mabel unintentionally struck him in the eye with his fist during a house show , forcing The Undertaker into a period of absence for surgery . Due to the incident happening at a house show , Vince McMahon had it presented to the audience as though it had occurred from Mabel and Yokozuna ' s exchange of leg drops and splashes on The Undertaker on the Monday Night Raw that had aired 2 days prior . The Undertaker returned a couple months later at Survivor Series , in which he single - handedly eliminated an entire team of wrestlers led by King Mabel , The Undertaker leading his own team to victory . It was at that Survivor Series return in which he began wearing a Phantom of the Opera - like , gray upper - face mask to safeguard his orbital injury while it healed . The following month in December , The Undertaker defeated Mabel in a casket match at In Your House , finally retrieving back the urn ( though still in its bling form ) in the process , which had been traded around between several of The Undertaker ' s antagonists over the entire course of that year .

After the buildup to his second heel run in the latter part of 1998 , The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 — a dark priest - like character who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness . In this form , he took on a wicked , demonic presence , much more so than ever before . He often proclaimed to be invoking and taking orders from a " Higher Power " . Moreover , he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne with a towering backrest specially designed into his crucifix - like logo . With the help of his minions , he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers , using various incantations and magic words with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry . The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of The Brood ( Christian , Edge and Gangrel ) , The Acolytes ( Bradshaw and Faarooq ) , Mideon and Viscera . Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period , having undergone a hip replacement . As part of the angle , Undertaker had his Ministry members fight his battles , carry out his evil wishes and do all his dirty deeds . In this manner , he expressed his desires to take over the World Wrestling Federation , displacing its owner , Mr . McMahon . These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and The Corporation , ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer , Big Boss Man . The two faced off in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania XV , which Undertaker won . At Backlash : In Your House , Undertaker defeated Corporation member Ken Shamrock after interference from Ministry member Bradshaw .	What was your persona during this period?

In the storyline leading up to WrestleMania XX , Kane was tormented by horror - themed mind games , paranormal activities , and spooking vignettes proclaiming The Undertaker ' s Deadman return . The first was during the Royal Rumble when The Undertaker ' s bells tolled , distracting Kane and allowing Booker T to eliminate him . Accompanied by Paul Bearer at WrestleMania XX , The Undertaker resurrected his Deadman identity , defeating Kane in a singles match . Introduced was a more dramatic , theatrical and supernatural Deadman than in years past , his presence , mannerisms , and entrances significantly elaborated on as well , such as with more intensity , special effects and rising and falling flames . At the same time , The Undertaker maintained elements of his American Badass identity , thus a composite character more humanized than all of his previous Deadman incarnations ( Undertaker would present in this particular hybrid Deadman form until No Mercy 2005 when Randy Orton sealed him in a casket and set it on fire ) . At Judgment Day , The Undertaker defeated Booker T . One week later , Paul Heyman ordered The Dudley Boyz to kidnap Bearer . Thus , Heyman " took control " of Undertaker . At The Great American Bash , Undertaker fought a handicap match against The Dudley Boyz , with the stipulation that if he did not lay down and purposely lose , Heyman would bury Paul Bearer in cement . The Undertaker won and stopped Heyman from burying Bearer , but after claiming Bearer was merely a liability he had no use for , buried him himself .	What distracted you during the Royal Rumble?	My bells tolled.
In spite of Bearer projecting himself as a constant source of mental distress to The Undertaker during his Championship title reign , The Undertaker managed to secure successful title defenses against Stone Cold Steve Austin ( A Cold Day In Hell : In Your House ) , Faarooq ( King of the Ring ) and Vader ( Canadian Stampede : In Your House , revisiting and settling their Royal Rumble feud from earlier on in the year ) , respectively . Concurrent to the " deep , dark secret " storyline directed by Bearer , Undertaker began a then new rivalry at SummerSlam when special guest referee Shawn Michaels accidentally hit him with a steel chair shot intended for his archnemesis Bret Hart , in effect , costing The Undertaker the WWF Championship . The accidental chair shot led to Michaels feeling betrayed by the now booing WWF fans , and quickly becoming heel . Thus , a severely violent storyline with The Undertaker followed , one revolving around repeated intentional chair shots by Michaels on The Undertaker , Michaels taunting The Undertaker throughout . After the duo ' s very first match , which was a chaotic and uncontrolled encounter that resulted in a double count - out draw at Ground Zero : In Your House , Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first ever Hell in a Cell match to take place at Badd Blood : In Your House . Despite the inclusion of the cell for more order and to prevent Michaels from receiving help from his D - Generation X stable , the encounter ended up even more uncontrolled and savage than their first and is considered among one of The Undertaker ' s best matches of his career . Seemingly about to emerge the victor after striking Michaels with a chair shot of his own , The Undertaker was interrupted by his storyline half - brother Kane , finally making his debut . Under the control of Paul Bearer , Kane stormed the arena , ripped off the cell door , and laid out a nonplussed Undertaker with his own trademarked finisher , The Tombstone Piledriver , allowing Michaels to pin him for the victory . As the storyline progressed through Bearer having Kane mow down much of the WWF roster , Kane repeatedly challenged The Undertaker , going to lengths of tormenting and humiliating him . However , The Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half - brother , claiming he had made a vow to his parents never to do harm to his own " flesh and blood " . The Undertaker ' s final encounter with Michaels during this chapter of his career was in a casket match for the WWF Championship at the Royal Rumble . The week before on Raw , Kane had duplicitously presented as allying with his brother against Michaels ' s D - Generation X stable ; however , at the Royal Rumble , Kane trapped The Undertaker in the coffin , padlocked the lid shut , and set the casket ablaze , allowing Michaels another victory . After a two - month hiatus in which Kane wreaked havoc over the WWF , The Undertaker returned on the March 2 , 1998 , edition of Raw in a most notable resurrection — his druids interrupting Kane and Bearer by presenting them with a coffin on the entrance stage amid a large number of bell tolls . The coffin was struck and dismantled by a lightning bolt , revealing a lied out Undertaker who sat up in a fury state and challenged Kane to do battle with him . At WrestleMania XIV in their first match , The Undertaker defeated Kane . Kane challenged Undertaker to a rematch — Kane ' s specialty and first ever Inferno match — that occurred one month later at Unforgiven : In Your House . The Undertaker won the encounter by setting Kane ' s right arm on fire .	Who interrupted you during the Hell in a Cell match?	My storyline half-brother Kane.

Seeking retribution , The Undertaker revisited his feud with Yokozuna and eventually faced him in a casket rematch at Survivor Series . Chuck Norris ( portraying his Walker , Texas Ranger persona ) was involved in the match as special guest enforcer , preventing interference from wrestlers that Yokozuna , Jim Cornette and Mr . Fuji had again enlisted for help . Unable to rely on much as far as interference this time around ( only Irwin R . Schyster able to get in a brief ambush ) due to Norris averting the attempts of several heel wrestlers , Yokozuna was defeated by The Undertaker and sealed in the casket . Throughout most of 1995 , Undertaker feuded with members of Ted DiBiase ' s Million Dollar Corporation . The chain of wrestlers DiBiase enlisted to do away with The Undertaker started with Irwin R . Schyster at the Royal Rumble for which The Undertaker was victorious , but assaulted by another member of the Million Dollar Team , King Kong Bundy .

After being buried alive and a following month - long hiatus , The Undertaker returned at the Survivor Series again pitting him against Mankind , but with a unique stipulation : Hanging 6.1   m ( 20   ft ) above the ring would be Paul Bearer , enclosed in a steel cage . And if The Undertaker were to win the match , he would be rewarded the opportunity to assault Bearer however he pleased . Even though The Undertaker won this match , interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape Undertaker ' s clutches . It was also at this event that The Undertaker had developed a comparatively more humanized and more informal yet still superhuman " Deadman " incarnation . In this then new form , he took on a Goth appearance and persona , with a brash , rebelling , Championship - driven mean streak ( perhaps to better fit in with the then - budding , more adult - oriented Attitude Era ) . This delivering , dubbed " The Lord of Darkness " , was the 3rd incarnation of his Deadman persona . Following Survivor Series , The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner , who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival . At In Your House 12 : It ' s Time , The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match even with Mankind heavily involved throughout the entire encounter . The Undertaker then moved on to feud with Vader , whom he faced in January 1997 at the Royal Rumble in a singles match , which The Undertaker lost after Bearer interfered on behalf of his new prot é g é .

He faced both Vader and Austin in a four - corners elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at In Your House 13 : Final Four , but Bret Hart won . However , the following month , The Undertaker managed to win the WWF Championship for the second time by defeating Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13 .
