Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013 , eventually equalling Real Madrid ' s 100 - point record of the previous season .

After losing successive Cl á sicos , including the Copa del Rey semi - finals , they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by AC Milan , but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4 – 0 comeback , with two goals and an assist from Messi . Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona , Messi signed a new contract on 7 February , committing himself to the club through 2018 , while his fixed wage rose to € 13   million . He wore the captain ' s armband for the first time a month later , on 17 March , in a league match against Rayo Vallecano ; by then , he had become the team ' s tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier , L á szl ó Kubala and Johan Cruyff . Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier , his input into the team ' s attack had increased ; from 24% in their treble - winning campaign , his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season .
