Love is the subject of the majority of Carey ' s lyrics , although she has written about themes such as loss , sex , race , abuse and spirituality . She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical , but Time magazine ' s Christopher John Farley wrote : " If only Mariah Carey ' s music had the drama of her life .

Carey ' s subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with Daydream . Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary - tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip - hop and R & B . On Butterfly , Carey collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff , such as Sean Combs , Q - Tip , Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters . In mid - 1997 , after four years of marriage , Carey and Mottola separated . Carey described Mottola as increasingly controlling , and viewed her newfound independence as a new lease on life . In the booklet of her twelfth studio album , Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel ( 2009 ) , Carey wrote that she considers Butterfly her magnum opus and a turning point in both her life and career . Butterfly introduced a more subdued style of singing , with critics noting Carey ' s incorporation of breathy vocals . Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity , while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess . The music video for the album ' s lead single , " Honey " , her first since separating from Mottola , introduced a more overtly sexual image . Butterfly became Carey ' s best - reviewed album , with attention placed on the album ' s exploration of more mature lyrical themes . In their review of the album , Rolling Stone wrote " [ It ' s ] not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine , Houston - style balladry ... but the predominant mood of ' Butterfly ' is one of coolly erotic reverie . " AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey ' s vocals as " sultrier and more controlled than ever , " and felt the album " illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music , which makes her a rarity among her ' 90s peers . ' " " Honey " and " My All " , the album ' s fifth single , both topped the Hot 100 , making Carey a female artist with the most number - one singles in the chart ' s history . Though a commercial success , Butterfly failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums , Music Box and Daydream .	When did you and Mottola separate?	We separated in mid-1997.

Multiple media sources referred to Carey as the " Queen of Melisma " . According to Rolling Stone , " Her mastery of melisma , the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like " Vision of Love " , inspired the entire American Idol vocal school , for better or worse , and virtually every other female R & B singer since the Nineties . " Chart historian Tom Breihan chose " Vision of Love " as one of the chapters in his book The Number Ones : Twenty Chart - Topping Hits That Reveal the History of Pop Music , stating that the song " set the stage for a whole decade of showy , pyrotechnic ' 90s R & B vocals .

" Chart historian Tom Breihan chose " Vision of Love " as one of the chapters in his book The Number Ones : Twenty Chart - Topping Hits That Reveal the History of Pop Music , stating that the song " set the stage for a whole decade of showy , pyrotechnic ' 90s R & B vocals . Carey created an environment where her disciples could flourish , and she did it by constructing " Vision Of Love " as a showcase for her voice " . In 2008 , Jody Rosen of Slate wrote of Carey ' s influence in modern music , calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades , the person who made rococo melismatic singing . Rosen further exemplified Carey ' s influence by drawing a parallel with American Idol , which to her , " often played out as a clash of melisma - mad Mariah wannabes . And , today , nearly 20 years after Carey ' s debut , major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain ' s X Factor show , Leona Lewis , with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah ' s big voice and big hair . " New York Magazine ' s editor Roger Deckker further commented that " Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma ( the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty ) to the charts , but it was Mariah â€” with her jaw - dropping range â€” who made it into America ' s default sound . " Deckker also added that " Every time you turn on American Idol , you are watching her children . " As Professor Katherine L . Meizel said in her book , The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol , " Carey ' s influence ( is ) in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe ' s , it ' s also her persona , her diva , her stardom which inspires them ... a pre - fame conic look . " With her ability to do runs , scats , and incredible control using whistle register , Mariah Carey is credited for popularizing this technique in mainstream music , making her name synonymous with the term .
