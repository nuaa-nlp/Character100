While sporting the flashy bling around his neck , he repeatedly cost The Undertaker matches and attacked diehard Undertaker fans , dubbed \" Creatures of the Night \" . In August , Undertaker settled the score with Kama , defeating him in a casket match at SummerSlam . Several weeks later , Undertaker suffered a serious orbital bone injury when King Mabel unintentionally struck him in the eye with his fist during a house show , forcing The Undertaker into a period of absence for surgery . Due to the incident happening at a house show , Vince McMahon had it presented to the audience as though it had occurred from Mabel and Yokozuna ' s exchange of leg drops and splashes on The Undertaker on the Monday Night Raw that had aired 2 days prior . The Undertaker returned a couple months later at Survivor Series , in which he single - handedly eliminated an entire team of wrestlers led by King Mabel , The Undertaker leading his own team to victory . It was at that Survivor Series return in which he began wearing a Phantom of the Opera - like , gray upper - face mask to safeguard his orbital injury while it healed . The following month in December , The Undertaker defeated Mabel in a casket match at In Your House , finally retrieving back the urn ( though still in its bling form ) in the process , which had been traded around between several of The Undertaker ' s antagonists over the entire course of that year .

Many critics believe that Shakespeare ' s greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art . The titular hero of one of Shakespeare ' s greatest tragedies , Hamlet , has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character , especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \" To be or not to be ; that is the question \" . Unlike the introverted Hamlet , whose fatal flaw is hesitation , the heroes of the tragedies that followed , Othello and King Lear , are undone by hasty errors of judgement . The plots of Shakespeare ' s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws , which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves . In Othello , the villain Iago stokes Othello ' s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him . In King Lear , the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers , initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear ' s youngest daughter Cordelia . According to the critic Frank Kermode , \" the play ... offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty \" . In Macbeth , the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare ' s tragedies , uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife , Lady Macbeth , to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn . In this play , Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure . His last major tragedies , Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus , contain some of Shakespeare ' s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T . S . Eliot .

His biographers have variously categorised him , in terms of political ideology , as \" fundamentally conservative \" , \" ( always ) liberal in outlook \" , and \" never circumscribed by party affiliation \" . Jenkins says that Churchill ' s self - belief was \" far stronger than any class or tribal loyalty \" . Whether Churchill was a conservative or a liberal , he was nearly always opposed to socialism because of its propensity for state planning and his belief in free markets . The exception was during his wartime coalition when he was completely reliant upon the support of his Labour colleagues . Although the Labour leaders were willing to join his coalition , Churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class . His response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and his anti - socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists . They saw him as a reactionary who represented imperialism , militarism , and the interests of the upper classes in the class war . His role in opposing the General Strike earned the enmity of many strikers and most members of the Labour movement . Paradoxically , Churchill was supportive of trade unionism , which he saw as the \" antithesis of socialism \" . Now you need to answer the question \"Why were you opposed to socialism?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",

In March 1613 , he bought a gatehouse in the former Blackfriars priory ; and from November 1614 , he was in London for several weeks with his son - in - law , John Hall . After 1610 , Shakespeare wrote fewer plays , and none are attributed to him after 1613 .

The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy , albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms . It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage . Certainly , by 1527 , he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was \" blighted in the eyes of God \" . Indeed , in marrying Catherine , his brother ' s wife , he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20 : 21 , a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null . [ nb 2 ] Martin Luther , on the other hand , had initially argued against the annulment , stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce . Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment . It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled , forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack . In going public , all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost . Henry sent his secretary , William Knight , to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull . Knight was unsuccessful ; the Pope could not be misled so easily .
