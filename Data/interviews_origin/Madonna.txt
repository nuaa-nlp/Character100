I'm only here cause there isn't a Knicks game, don't get excited. 
Why are you so obsessed with my sex life? 
He's not tall enough. 
yeah well I've never succumbed to peer pressure. 
Incidentally, you are a sick . 
I don't know why I get so much . 
You're twisted. 
Wait a minute, Aren't you going to smell them? 
I gave them to you for a reason. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
I gave him, my, come on, I gave him my underpants and he won't smell... 
That's not where they go. 
No, that's where, that's where you keep my panties. 
Isn't that an oxymoron? An untrue rumor. 
Isn't that sort of like jumbo shrimp? 
Untrue rumor, I mean that's like funny David Letterman. 
That microphone is really long. 
Speaking of the NBA. 
I always go there, and really I don't care, I mean. 
I wouldn't go that far. 
I don't think he understands the meaning of friendship. 
I thought you were going to ask me if it hurt something else, but, I thought you were going to continue the Charles Barkely line of questioning. 
And the question, and the answer is, um... 
It hurt, the answer is yes, both questions. 
What happens whey you take it out? 
Both questions? 
Listen, all you do is talk about my sex life on your show, so now you don't want to talk about my sex life when I'm on your show. 
You can't get through a show without talking about me or thinking about me. 
It's never a problem. 
I don't think we should ever cut to a commercial. 
Let's keep talking and film every second of it. 
Before, wait, wait, wait, before we cut to a commercial, I just want to know...um is that a rug? 
Don't make me act a fool, Dave, alright. 
Don't make me, do you want to touch my dress? 
And he's going to smell my underwear. 
You really have, you really... 
You know you really changed since the last time I was on the show. 
You used to be really kind of, like, cool. 
Money's made you soft. 
Because you just kiss up to everybody on your show now. 
You do man, you're always kissing up to like all, I see all these, like you know movie stars coming here and you just all ga-ga, you should just give people a hard time. 
I believe you have already. 
Don't treat me special, Ok? 
I wouldn't want you to do that. 
About you or life in general? 
No let's just get back to you. 
You are not irritating me. 
Are you trying to? 
Actually you do irritate me sometimes. 
Why are you always ...Actually I brought something, to like make a point... 
Because you are always  with me on the show. 
You are always  with me on the show. 
You are always  with me on the show. 
Where is that thing? 
Will you shut up please, can we... let's get to the tape, I brought a tape to prove that he's obsessed with my, obsessed with me. 
What's that all about? 
My ass looks a lot better than that. 
It's just the right size. 
Don't  with me Dave 
Aren't there any other segments? That's it? 
I like the way you say my name, by the way. 
Somebody fucked up. 
Yah I'm sitting on it. 
There seems to be a lot of confusion right now. 
Is it cause I've been saying ? 
Speak the truth or train the devil baby. 
Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. 
People don't want to hear the word  in their... 
I want to know, what do people... 
There is definitely something wrong with me... 
... I'm sitting here. 
Anyways, what, oooh... 
I don't think we should... 
I don't think, I think we should break the rules... 
... tonight...I think we should ... 
Yeah, you just, Dave just slobbered all over my cigar. 
This is the closest I'm ever going to get to kissing you. 
We'll you're not in the NBA, so forget about it. 
Want to get it? 
See, I haven't dated that many basketball players. 
That was a very subtle joke. 
Are you talkin' to me? 
This seems all very rehearsed. 
Why did you have to go and read a top ten list? 
Well, actually I have seen the show, but I've never, I mean I've always been doing something while I was watching the show. 
I don't really, it's not funny  forget it. 
We're going to have to deal with each other. 
No holds, barred. 
Tape? Why can't we just talk to each other, why do we have to have all of this contrived ? 
You know,  the tape,  the list, everything....you know what I'm saying? 
I think we should get...don't you want to show everybody the underwear. 
No they haven't seen, they haven't seen my unde.. mine ... 
No, no, no, no, they saw me out of my underwear, they haven't seen me in my underwear. 
Don't make me act a fool, Dave. 
Really? In what way? 
What part of your body? 
Isn't there anything you really want to ask me? 
You don't know a  damn thing. 
That's what you want to know? 
No, that's not what you want to know. 
Did you know that it's good if you pee in the shower? 
No seriously, peeing in the shower is really good, it, it fights um um athletes foot. 
I'm serious, no urine is like, is like, is like an antiseptic, it's all got to do with the enzymes in your body. 
I wanted to share something that I knew with you. 
Do you have a girlfriend? 
I thought you were going to ask me if I had a girlfriend. Um. 
Look I don't want to ... 
Can't this just go on and on? 
It's not really this late anyway, this is all a fantasy. 
We are living ahead of the time when it actually is. 
Don't fuck with me Dave? 
Don't make me act a fool. 
Wait a minute, I just want to ask you one more question. 
Have you ever smoked Endo? 
Have you ever smoked Endo? 
You're a  damn liar! 
Well, you should. 
Oh, oh, oh, and pee in the shower. 
Don't tell me you haven't peed in the shower. 
Everybody pees in the shower and everybody picks their nose. 
Why do we have to be, why do you keep flashing that card? 
Can't we just break the rules? 
Who said that? 
Is the show almost over? 
We only have a few minutes. 
When you come back I'll still be here,  it! 
Yes. Yes. I thought I he thought -- I think he thought he could make it more modern and funnier. 
You mean that unsympathetic? 
Yes. Yes, that's another way to put it. Thanks Larry. 
It was -- yes. It's fun doing a villain. 
Totally. And then -- and then suddenly things turn around and he becomes the villain. And then for the last third... 
Yes, and then he's the bad guy. 
Yes. They're really good. Guy is really good at casting, and I love all the characters on the boat. 
Aren't they fantastic? 
Yes, totally. Yes. 
Huge difference. The biggest difference is that they're just from the minute they can express themselves. 
All they're interested in is cars. Cars. 
Toys. Cars. Wheels. 
Mechanics. How things work. You know what I mean? 
I mean, it's just in their molecular structure. 
Girls, you know, dolls and dresses and putting makeup on and wearing high heels and, I mean... 
I think boys are harder in the beginning, and I think they become more independent later. And I think it's the reverse. 
Yes, wow, so a lot's happened for both of us. 
Yes, all for the better. 
It's been great. How many years was it? 
Like three years. So much has happened. 
I live -- I live a highly scheduled life. There's absolutely no time wasted. I'm very focused. 
And I have a great assistant. 
Very important, yes. 
Yes. My emphasis -- my priority is my family, absolutely, 100 percent. But somehow we make things work. 
We don't sleep very much. 
We shot the movie in Malta in Sardinia, and obviously it was, you know, a huge benefit that I was married to the director and so we were together as a family the entire time. 
And that was fabulous. I loved it. 
You know what? When my nannies have days off... 
... I ask the same question. How do people do this all the time? 
I mean, you don't have a job. You can't -- taking care of children is a full-time job, and I have total respect for women who do it completely on their own. 
No. Absolutely not. 
Yes. I am. I have, yes. 
Yes, I'm always looking for something new, a new inspiration, a new philosophy, a new way to look at something, new talent. 
I like people that are hungry. And I like to take old things and reinterpret them in new ways so... 
Well, I wear the Jewish star, but I'm not -- I haven't converted to Judaism and I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not Jewish in the conventional sense because the Kaballah is a belief system that predates religion and predates Judaism as an organized religion. 
But I think people have misinterpreted and/or have left out the true and deep metaphysical reasons for all of those things. 
I was looking for something. I mean, I'd begun practicing yoga and, you know, I was looking for the answers to life. 
Why am I here? What am I doing here? What is my purpose? 
How do I fit into the big picture? I know there's more to life than making lots of money and being successful and even getting married and having a family. 
What's it all mean and why's there so much chaos in the world? And is this just the way it goes? You know, and I wanted to know the answers. 
He's a rabbi, yes. 
It is the mystical interpretation of the Torah, yes. 
The Old Testament. But you know what? Jesus was a cabalist. 
Jesus was a rabbi. And essentially Christianity took a very important concept of the Kaballah, which is love thy neighbor as thyself, and that became the foundation of Christianity. 
Obviously it's been, you know -- unfortunately Christianity has taken certain things out of context. 
I mean, there's no point in killing people if they don't become Christians. That's not -- it's got nothing to do with loving your neighbor as yourself. 
During the crusades for instance. Yes. Yes. 
Yes. Well, I, you know, I introduced it to him because I study it and he was curious, and he was very skeptical at first being a Darwinist and not at all interested in spirituality, but... 
First of all, like I said, there's no dogma, and, I mean, things like -- things like eating kosherly or honoring the Sabbath. 
There's a 1 percent reason, the reason that we -- that most Jews know about and even Christians know about. 
And then there's the metaphysical reason behind it. 
As you would have them do unto you. 
Did you ask him about the gym? 
Well I wasn't very happy. What kind of a gym could you possibly carry? 
He showed me the gym. 
I was pretty understanding, actually. 
What are you doing haunting our corridors when you have beautiful there? 
I hope I haven't hurt your feelings. 
And don't be so touchy . Can't we just get along? 
I see you've got your dancing shoes on. 
What's the matter? Don't you want to dance with me? 
As opposed to what? 
That's good. I like that. 
No, I didn't. I didn't. I had no idea. 
I mean, when I started -- when I got signed to a record deal I was Madonna Ciccone. And then...it just got shortened. 
And then it was Madonna. And then it -- I mean, I didn't want to like rock the boat, I guess, in the beginning. 
It's my mother's name. I was named after my mother. 
Yes, I'm a second. 
Yes. I did. I mean, I think I had a -- I had moments of chaos and sometimes I suffered. 
I mean, my mother died when I was little, and that was difficult for me for a while. 
Father, and then eventually he remarried and my stepmother, yes. 
I mean, truthfully, I didn't accept my stepmother when I was growing up. In that retrospect I think I was really hard on her. 
Yes, and I'm very close to my father, and I didn't want to accept change... 
Everyone tells me I did. I mean, when I talk to my relatives they all say, you know... 
You've been a showgirl since you were 5, and I don't remember it, but I guess... 
When I was a teenager I wanted to be a dancer. I wanted to move to New York and be a dancer. That was my goal, and that was my dream. 
It was pretty small. 
Detroit. Pontiac. Rochester. 
Well, I was dancing for years in Manhattan and not making a very good living. And I started auditioning for a musical theater, and somebody saw me at an audition singing and dancing and... 
... and they said hey, sweetheart, we're going to make you a star type of thing. And they were French. 
And they took me to Paris and they kind of put me into this star making machinery, but I wasn't ready for it. 
And after six months I flipped out and had to come back to New York. 
It probably started off as a song on the radio, and then it -- and then I think it was an appearance at the MTV awards, where I think I was rolling around on the stage in my underpants. 
And I think I did something like that. 
Was it planned? Was it... 
I don't know. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. I was very impulsive in my youth. 
I'm trying not to be. I'm trying to think before I say and do. 
I just was living in the moment and living like an instinctive animal. 
Sure. Absolutely. 
Yes. It's important to see the end and the beginning. KING: How did you deal initially with fame? 
Well, I thought it was fun in the beginning. I mean, I didn't mind it at all. 
Yes, sure. It appealed to my ego. 
Sure, I mean, when people start chasing you down the street, and I never had a moment of privacy, you know, or when people started taking shots at me and being nasty in the press. 
Things like that. 
Don't read the newspapers. Don't read magazines, and don't watch TV, sorry. I'll watch this interview though. 
I mean, at the end of day I just don't -- it's not going to do me any good. I mean, most of it is sensationalists, television, magazine, press, whatever. 
It's weird, but, you know, I suppose they're interested in all celebrities' personal lives. 
Living vicariously through everybody, you know. 
I think everybody does. It's like the old watching the car accident thing. You know, you can't take your eyes off of it. 
People like to see you go up and they love to see you go down. 
I'm sure I'm guilty of it, you know. I'd like to say, you know, I do find myself -- I hear a little bit of a snippet of gossip about someone and then they go, oh really? 
And then I go I'm doing that. I'm doing that. That's not good. 
Totally. Totally. It's our nature. 
And I'm trying to work against that so... 
Yes, I mean, don't all singers and... 
Well, I mean, you are selling your own image, right, when... 
Pretty good, I won't say I've never made... 
"Speed the Plow." 
Why's she doing a Davd Mammet Play... 
No, they sure don't. 
For the experience. I mean, I don't need the money, and I'm in -- I'm in a very luxurious place in my life. 
I can do things because I want to do them, because I want -- I want the experience. 
I did. I did a play and I... 
... didn't get paid for that either. 
Yes. Yes, but it was a fantastic experience, and I enjoyed every minute of it. 
I like how real it is. I like that you are really out there with no protections. When you make a movie you get a chance to do another take. 
When you're on stage you say the line wrong, that's it. It's out there, it happened, and I like the immediacy of it. 
You go from start to finish... 
No, no, no. It's preferable to acting in film. 
The crowds, you mean. 
I did for "Speed the Plow." 
There's no music. 
I know. How freaky is that? 
Well, by the time we hired him we knew it, but when he auditioned for it we didn't know it. Even when we were watching the videotapes of the auditions we didn't know. 
It wasn't until we went back and looked at the piece of paper that said his name, we're like no, that's too weird. 
He's been a camera operator for eight years. He's been -- the movie he did with us was his second film. 
No, but he's a real natural. 
No. We really liked each other. We enjoyed... 
Well, now Larry I wasn't really making love to him. 
I had to hug him. I kind of kissed him. 
Yes. Well, I mean, and it's implied for a reason. I mean, you don't need to see it. 
You get it, right? 
Exactly. So was it weird? Yes, it was totally weird, especially with the man I love directing me. 
It was strange, and Adriano felt strange too, but we tried to just kind of jolly each other along through it all. 
It was surprisingly easy I have to say because, I mean, we have a shorthand with each other in terms of communication so he didn't have to beat around the bush and say, oh, can you, you know. 
He'd just say, you know, wife, over there. You know, over there. 
Well, we did a video together. I... 
Yes, for a song called "What It Feels Like For A Girl," and I loved working with him on that. And that we did a five minute commercial for BMW for the Internet, and we really enjoyed working together. 
I met him at a lunch at a sort of garden party in the middle of the summer in the backyard of Sting and Trudy's house in London in the English countryside. 
Love at first sight? 
Major chemistry, yes, absolutely. 
Gosh, two years after that? 
Well, it was a long distance relationship for a while because he lived in England and I lived in America. 
So for a year it was long distance angst, a very high phone bill, and a lot of trips back and forth on the Concorde from New York to London and vice versa. 
Relationships? 
Yes, I think I pretty much -- I mean, the main thing I learned was that I was always, you know, jumping to conclusions, making decisions too quickly, and chasing people for the wrong reasons so... 
I don't know, I just do. 
Yes. It's just in my gut. Yes. 
Absolutely. And we're good friends. And he's a great person. 
And so I have no complaints. I'm very lucky that all turned out really good. 
I still ask the price. 
I know, but I do anyway. 
To not have to worry about... 
Well, it's, you know, it's great to have that luxury in life to not have to worry, to know that, you know, I don't ever have to worry about where my food's going to come from and the roof over my head. 
But obviously you and I both know that that's not the most important thing in the world. I mean... 
But money is like everything. Money is like sex. It's like food. 
It's, you know, they're all manifestations of God. They're blessings that we get, but they're not -- they're not -- that's not what's going to make us happy. 
They're not real. They don't last. 
I was in Los Angeles. I was on tour. 
Not after that. 
Yes, yes, yes, no, I woke up to my nanny crying and telling me what was going on at 6 in the morning. 
I just, you know, I felt -- it felt really surreal like it wasn't really happening. 
I'll have you arrested. 
Sell me that fish. 
I want that fish so sell it to me. 
What are you doing? 
That is not true. Do I look like I've missed any meals? 
No, you're not allowed -- well, it's not good to eat toast because it's... 
No, that's why when I'm sneaking and I'm having a moment of decadence I eat toast with strawberry jam... 
Well, macrobiotic means big life and it means getting the most of life -- most life out of your food. 
Fish. Grains, some kind of grains. Some kind of cooked vegetable. 
Salad. Simple, but tasty. 
It's called "Die Another Day." It's just the same as the title of the film. 
Yes. It's all...It's in the can. 
Well, no, I hemmed and hawed about it for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what everybody else likes to do. 
It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? 
James Bond needs to get -- needs to get techno so... 
Yes. KING: Got a new album coming? 
I do in the beginning of next year. 
Almost done with it. I'm going to finish it in the next few months. 
I don't know. I'm thinking of a nice Hebrew word. What do you think? 
Ein sof. What do you think of that? 
Ein sof means endlessness. 
What do you think? 
How about i'n sof? 
Yes, I am. Life is good. 
I don't know. London, New York and Los Angeles. 
My favorite city is New York. Yes. Love it. 
Yes. That's where I really grew up. 
Life requires a lot of organization. 
Well, I'm going to try my damndest to make sure that doesn't happen. 
No. They don't watch TV. 
They read books. They hear what we have to say. They have friends. 
Because there's a lot of junk on TV. KING: Oh there's a lot of good things though too ain't there? 
I know, but I'd rather -- I'd prefer that they read books and that they communicate with each other. 
That's a tough one. I mean I think. 
I do. I love everything I do. I would never -- I don't know. 
Dancing's my first love. 
My first, first, first love. Yes. And then I would be singing. 
And then it would be writing. And then it would be acting. 
OK. Otherwise you might have a whole tribe the next time I come back. 
OK? Knock that stuff off. 
And mazel tov to you too. 
You'll be right back with my husband. 
Don't go away. 
Go, go! Oh, yeah! 
Oh, forgive me for being in a rush to get back to civilization. 
The adventure is just starting for you, my friend. Jsut wait until my lawyer speaks to your captain. 
Oh, so "madam" is it now? Changed our tune now that we're on land, haven't we? 
Why? So you can forget about me? No chance, sailor. 
Yes. Yes. I thought I he thought -- I think he thought he could make it more modern and funnier. 
You mean that unsympathetic? 
Yes. Yes, that's another way to put it. Thanks Larry. 
It was -- yes. It's fun doing a villain. 
Totally. And then -- and then suddenly things turn around and he becomes the villain. And then for the last third... 
Yes, and then he's the bad guy.

Huge difference. The biggest difference is that they're just from the minute they can express themselves.

Toys. Cars. Wheels.

I think boys are harder in the beginning, and I think they become more independent later. And I think it's the reverse.

I'm trying not to be. I'm trying to think before I say and do. 
I just was living in the moment and living like an instinctive animal. 
Sure. Absolutely. 
Yes. It's important to see the end and the beginning. KING: How did you deal initially with fame? 
Well, I thought it was fun in the beginning. I mean, I didn't mind it at all. 
Yes, sure. It appealed to my ego. 
Sure, I mean, when people start chasing you down the street, and I never had a moment of privacy, you know, or when people started taking shots at me and being nasty in the press. 
Things like that. 
Don't read the newspapers. Don't read magazines, and don't watch TV, sorry. I'll watch this interview though. 
I mean, at the end of day I just don't -- it's not going to do me any good. I mean, most of it is sensationalists, television, magazine, press, whatever. 
It's weird, but, you know, I suppose they're interested in all celebrities' personal lives. 
Living vicariously through everybody, you know. 
I think everybody does. It's like the old watching the car accident thing. You know, you can't take your eyes off of it. 
People like to see you go up and they love to see you go down. 
I'm sure I'm guilty of it, you know. I'd like to say, you know, I do find myself -- I hear a little bit of a snippet of gossip about someone and then they go, oh really? 
And then I go I'm doing that. I'm doing that. That's not good. 
Totally. Totally. It's our nature. 
And I'm trying to work against that so... 
Yes, I mean, don't all singers and... 
Well, I mean, you are selling your own image, right, when... 
Pretty good, I won't say I've never made... 
"Speed the Plow." 
Why's she doing a Davd Mammet Play... 
No, they sure don't. 
For the experience. I mean, I don't need the money, and I'm in -- I'm in a very luxurious place in my life. 
I can do things because I want to do them, because I want -- I want the experience. 
I did. I did a play and I... 
... didn't get paid for that either. 
Yes. Yes, but it was a fantastic experience, and I enjoyed every minute of it. 
I like how real it is. I like that you are really out there with no protections. When you make a movie you get a chance to do another take. 
When you're on stage you say the line wrong, that's it. It's out there, it happened, and I like the immediacy of it. 
You go from start to finish... 
No, no, no. It's preferable to acting in film. 
The crowds, you mean. 
I did for "Speed the Plow." 
There's no music. 
I know. How freaky is that? 
Well, by the time we hired him we knew it, but when he auditioned for it we didn't know it. Even when we were watching the videotapes of the auditions we didn't know. 
It wasn't until we went back and looked at the piece of paper that said his name, we're like no, that's too weird. 
He's been a camera operator for eight years. He's been -- the movie he did with us was his second film. 
No, but he's a real natural. 
No. We really liked each other. We enjoyed... 
Well, now Larry I wasn't really making love to him. 
I had to hug him. I kind of kissed him. 
Yes. Well, I mean, and it's implied for a reason. I mean, you don't need to see it. 
You get it, right? 
Exactly. So was it weird? Yes, it was totally weird, especially with the man I love directing me. 
It was strange, and Adriano felt strange too, but we tried to just kind of jolly each other along through it all. 
It was surprisingly easy I have to say because, I mean, we have a shorthand with each other in terms of communication so he didn't have to beat around the bush and say, oh, can you, you know. 
He'd just say, you know, wife, over there. You know, over there. 
Well, we did a video together. I... 
Yes, for a song called "What It Feels Like For A Girl," and I loved working with him on that. And that we did a five minute commercial for BMW for the Internet, and we really enjoyed working together. 
I met him at a lunch at a sort of garden party in the middle of the summer in the backyard of Sting and Trudy's house in London in the English countryside. 
Love at first sight? 
Major chemistry, yes, absolutely. 
Gosh, two years after that? 
Well, it was a long distance relationship for a while because he lived in England and I lived in America. 
So for a year it was long distance angst, a very high phone bill, and a lot of trips back and forth on the Concorde from New York to London and vice versa. 
Relationships? 
Yes, I think I pretty much -- I mean, the main thing I learned was that I was always, you know, jumping to conclusions, making decisions too quickly, and chasing people for the wrong reasons so... 
I don't know, I just do. 
Yes. It's just in my gut. Yes. 
Absolutely. And we're good friends. And he's a great person. 
And so I have no complaints. I'm very lucky that all turned out really good. 
I still ask the price. 
I know, but I do anyway. 
To not have to worry about... 
Well, it's, you know, it's great to have that luxury in life to not have to worry, to know that, you know, I don't ever have to worry about where my food's going to come from and the roof over my head. 
But obviously you and I both know that that's not the most important thing in the world. I mean... 
But money is like everything. Money is like sex. It's like food. 
It's, you know, they're all manifestations of God. They're blessings that we get, but they're not -- they're not -- that's not what's going to make us happy. 
They're not real. They don't last. 
I was in Los Angeles. I was on tour. 
Not after that. 
Yes, yes, yes, no, I woke up to my nanny crying and telling me what was going on at 6 in the morning. 
I just, you know, I felt -- it felt really surreal like it wasn't really happening. 
I'll have you arrested. 
Sell me that fish. 
I want that fish so sell it to me. 
What are you doing? 
That is not true. Do I look like I've missed any meals? 
No, you're not allowed -- well, it's not good to eat toast because it's... 
No, that's why when I'm sneaking and I'm having a moment of decadence I eat toast with strawberry jam... 
Well, macrobiotic means big life and it means getting the most of life -- most life out of your food. 
Fish. Grains, some kind of grains. Some kind of cooked vegetable. 
Salad. Simple, but tasty. 
It's called "Die Another Day." It's just the same as the title of the film. 
Yes. It's all...It's in the can. 
Well, no, I hemmed and hawed about it for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what everybody else likes to do. 
It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then I thought about it and I said, you know what? 
James Bond needs to get -- needs to get techno so... 
Yes. KING: Got a new album coming? 
I do in the beginning of next year. 
Almost done with it. I'm going to finish it in the next few months. 
I don't know. I'm thinking of a nice Hebrew word. What do you think? 
Ein sof. What do you think of that? 
Ein sof means endlessness. 
What do you think? 
How about i'n sof? 
Yes, I am. Life is good. 
I don't know. London, New York and Los Angeles. 
My favorite city is New York. Yes. Love it. 
Yes. That's where I really grew up. 
Life requires a lot of organization. 
Well, I'm going to try my damndest to make sure that doesn't happen. 
No. They don't watch TV. 
They read books. They hear what we have to say. They have friends. 
Because there's a lot of junk on TV. KING: Oh there's a lot of good things though too ain't there? 
I know, but I'd rather -- I'd prefer that they read books and that they communicate with each other. 
That's a tough one. I mean I think. 
I do. I love everything I do. I would never -- I don't know. 
Dancing's my first love. 
My first, first, first love. Yes. And then I would be singing. 
And then it would be writing. And then it would be acting. 
OK. Otherwise you might have a whole tribe the next time I come back. 
OK? Knock that stuff off. 
And mazel tov to you too. 
You'll be right back with my husband. 
Don't go away. 
Go, go! Oh, yeah! 
Oh, forgive me for being in a rush to get back to civilization. 
The adventure is just starting for you, my friend. Jsut wait until my lawyer speaks to your captain. 
Oh, so "madam" is it now? Changed our tune now that we're on land, haven't we? 
Why? So you can forget about me? No chance, sailor.
