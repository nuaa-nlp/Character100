We do write individually, so I mean like we go our separate ways for, when the tour's over our whatever, and then we sort of have a teething period where we sort of get together and sort of play each other the new songs, and then what happens is a sort of, a very huge sifting process, where we sort of find out what songs 
I spent about four years um, at Ealing School Of Art, Ealing College, oh God I mean it was a long time ago, during the Boer War I think, and I, I got my diploma in graphics and illustration, which I did nothing with, but I mean I was actually trained to be a sort of illustrator, which um, I'm glad I sorted of opted out and  because I think music is, is, was exactly what I wanted to do, and it wasn't a very um, a very risky sort of career to, to embark on 
Freddie with Simon Bates, BBC Radio 1 
And so we might as well get it right this time. People do associate me with um, the sort of simpering little ballads, but Brian has written some, some lovely ones in his time 
Oh, I mean, if you're referring to sort of a certain article about all that, that's meant to be taken tongue in cheek, but I mean it's just that, at this point in time, that's something that interests me, and I'm just trying to incorporate it in the stage act, nothing more really, and um, it's basically to enhance the music we play, I mean if it was, if it wasn't working then I wouldn't do it, and it's also a phase that I'm going through, and um, I like the Nijinsky costume 
It's good, his songs are getting better every time actually 
Am I vain? Well to a certain extent, yes, yeah, yeah, I have those ingredients yes  I like to feel that I, I'm, I, I look good at all times when I go out, I think it has, it's inner happiness, you know, it has to come from within 
Well I do, do you want me just to say some of them then? Teo torriatte konoma, konomama iko, aisuruhito yo, shizukana yoi ni, hikario tomoshi, itoshiki oshieo idaki 
Not really, I sort of um, I admire him yes, he's sort of, it's not as um, involved as that, I don't sort of take things like paintings too literally, the only time I did do that was in a song called 'Fairy Feller's Masterstroke', where I actually sort of, was, I was thoroughly inspired by um, a painting by Richard Dadd, which is in the Tate gallery, and I thought that sort of, er, did a lot of research on it, and it sort of inspired me to write um, a song about the painting, depicting what I thought I saw in it 
In a way yes, I mean we had the, the same three people singing on the, the big choir sections, but I think it had a, a different kind of techincal approach, because I mean it was a sort of gospel way of singing, which I think was different to us, and this is me sort of going on about Aretha Franklin, and sort of made them go a bit mad, I just wanted to write something in that kind of thing, I was sort of incensed by the, the sort of gospel approach that she had on her albums, on the earlier albums, although it might sound the, sort of same kind of approach on say the, the harmonies, it is very different in the studio because it's like a different kind of, actually a different range 
I think that's one of our best videos to date, really, in fact it still makes me chuckle every time I see it and um, I've seen it a lot of times, and I'm glad we did it. 
Not all the songs 
I, I don't watch too many movies, and I don't watch too much television, I have a very fastidious nature, and I'm very sort of, I am highly strung, a lot of people say this, so I'm very fidgety and everything, I do a lot of research by just looking, and by looking I mean, um, if I meet people or whatever, trying to find, or I go to art galleries and things like that, but I mean I, I'm sort of tuned into sort of very different things, I go to a lot of more, I go to opera, I, I, I, and I go to ballet and things like that, but I'm always researching in that way, it's like people read books or whatever, I just look at everything in pictures, really 
Basically I think we'd signed all the deals, I mean as, the recording deals and the publishing deals, so in effect we were signed to Trident and at a later stage Jack came in, Jack Nelson, who's the person we're talking about, came in to sort of look after the management side of things, so he was brought in at a later stage 
Oh yes, I mean the moment something um catches on, you're gonna get everybody jumping on the bandwagon, and then, and then what happens is that you have to sift the crop and, you know, the creme de la creme will actually um come across, you'll always get that. 
It was, it was 'I Was Born To Love You', you see, but he just said that he'd lost all, total meaning of what, what er, I was trying to say, but there you go 
It is, it certainly is, you need, you need  especially, say, for a band that's starting up, I mean they need the guidance and things, so a good manager is definitely vital 
I remember there was, there was a, a time and place in the early years where of course I wanted to be looked upon or whatever, and so therefore you, you did it accordingly, you know I wore Zandra Rhodes dresses and I paint-, painted my fingernails black, and I wore eye make-up, and I had long hair, I wore women's blouses and whatever, and then I would walk into a room and close it dead, you know, I mean that's the way to make an entrance, and you can do that, yeah, just like going back to it, just like what Boy George can do, I mean those things you can do if you're accepted, and now having gone through a lot of it I, I do want my privacy, it's like, it virtually it's like, I mean I've created my own monster really, and there are times where I wake up in the morning and I think 'oh my God, I wish I wasn't Freddie Mercury today' 
I can't read music that well, it takes me a long while 
With the finished song, yes 
An imaginative approach yes, I suppose you could 
'There Must Be More To Life Than This' was a, a song that I'd written a long time ago and it was going to be on one of the Queen albums and er, for some odd reason it just wasn't used because I'd written something else, and I remember that um, I mean a couple of years now, and I was working with Michael Jackson and we were trying to get some stuff together, and we still have unfinished works of art in the vaults actually, and they haven't come to fruition, but this was one of the songs , well because we haven't had to time to actually sort of go back and, and finish them 
I don't know, that, that's Mike Stone our engineer. We're very bad in the studio for that actually, the poor engineer has to really suffer because we really want as much level as possible, and we keep pushing the phasers up and he keeps looking at the meters and  and going 'oh it'll never cut, it'll never cut', and then we give him the added task of going over to New York or wherever and saying 'make sure that cuts as loud as possible' 
I suppose it could be um, put across that way yes, I was sort of learning a lot in, on this, on 'Sheer Heart Attack' we were sort of doing a lot of things that um, was to come in future albums, or was to sort of be used on, on the future albums, and songs like that, yes I suppose um, working out the kind of harmonies and things and the song structure did help a lot in say, something like 'Bohemian Rhapsody', it's true. 
The funny thing is, is, like, I must tell you, everybody thinks it probably was my idea because they think I am, but it's not, it, it wasn't at all, I mean, something like that was at the back of my mind, but if I'd approached the rest of the group it would have been disbanded, because it would have looked like OK I'm, I'm trying to dress them up in drag and all that, because everybody thinks that that's what I'm tuned to or whatever, but I, so the funny thing is the others came up with the idea and I said 'fine, I'll do it', and so it came to fruition, but I was shocked, actually to think that my God that they, they're expecting to actually dress up in drag, and I said fine, then I, I, I took the bull by the horns, and I just said 'right now we do it, now we do it properly', and for the first time in our lives that we were actually taking the mickey out of ourselves which is, I think in the early days people regarded Queen as being very sort of um, very musical, very intelligent, and they just thought that we actually lacked humour, but we had humour on the stage shows and our characters were then actually coming across, and I just thought why don't we try and do that in a video because that sort of precis, and, and, you know in three minutes they can find that out, and yet people were quite amazed the fact that we could actually fool around and drag up and still be good musicians 
Exactly, yes, yeah, that's very true, that's very true, yeah. But I mean we didn't do that video and think 'oh my God, it's not gonna be accepted here or whatever', we just did it, and in fact it um, in terms of America, it wasn't accepted at all, because I mean they, they still regard us as the heavy rockers and the macho and all that, and they said what, what, 'what are my idols doing dressing up in frocks' 
Oh yes, I think that's, that's way past, I mean I think, I think in a way I think I've sort of done a virtually a full circle, because I mean when you think being in the business sort of thirteen years, or even like fourteen years, I mean there seems, there was a sort of a kind of, I mean after the first five years when we, we had the taste of success, that's the time where I thought oh my God I was the bees knees and I mean nobody could speak to me, and I couldn't be seen in these places, but you learn to live with it, and afterwards you, you realise that it's, it's also growing up and getting experience, and now I think I'm, I'm not afraid to go anywhere, before I was taking bodyguards or whatever, it's, it's just a kind of discipline that you have to have, and, and kind of awareness, and I think um, there were times when there was the teeny bop stage where I mean we went to Japan and places, and there was hoardes of people screaming and things, but I think most people have grown up. 
Ooh, that's really good. I'd like to say that actually Brian did do a very good job on, on the actual guitars, he's really taken his guitar orchestration to it's limits, I don't know how he's going to, I don't think he'll ever over do them, out do that one actually. 
I learn a lot from, from, from our past albums, actually, see how they're constructed and things, and then you sort of use what you've done in the past and work out different things 
Oh, in what way do you mean? 
It's an easy way out 
It really depends, I mean if there's a reception laid on or whatever 
I think this tour, for me anyway, is going to be slightly special, because we've stayed away from touring for about two years, so it, I mean before I think touring became too much of the norm, and I, I was getting, I found myself in a rut, that's why I was the first one to actually decide that I wanted something like six months away from all the entire music industry. 
True, you'll always get that, you know I like that too, I mean if everybody prefered just the one type then um, we wouldn't be selling so many records, the fact that we, we still um, do different things is to try and um, make sure we get, we get a different audience aswell, we certainly don't want to sort of discard our early fans, because I mean they're always with us, I hope, but you'll always get that, yes, I mean some people like, you know when you come up with a song or an album, you won't get everybody liking everything, and the one, the trademark of Queen which I like is just, happens to be, it's like a coincidence, is that there are four writers that write very different material, and so it pleases maybe a wider span than, than most other groups 
Well, it was an adaptation of an earlier crest that I did, it was done by David Costa who sort of um, worked in conjunction with us, and made sure it was what we wanted, since then I mean as far as say marketing is concerned, it's a huge process, I mean it covers such a wide area, it's like we said before, we just sort of work on the album material and then we choose a single, in this case, 'A Night At The Opera' case, it happened to be 'Bohemian Rhapsody', and with that we made a film which helped us a lot, I mean we did it with Bruce Gowers 
We did take a lot of risks actually, I think most of them paid off I think 
That's the review of the album, you know what I mean, and they haven't a clue anyway, so  to them 
Here. That's the um, that's the end of side one of 'A Day At The Races'. A track, that was a track by John Deacon, his contribution to this album. 
And John played very good bass on that, and I think it's good, oh we're patting ourselves on the back again 
No, so that was a big risk element involved with everything, I mean, since 'Bohemian Rhapsody', so we're not gonna change, and I think our sort of staunchest fans are gonna know that we, we can come with all kinds of ridiculous things, and some of them will work, some won't. 
It covers such a lot of area, it really depends on what kind of song really, I think um, I think at that time, I was, I was, um, learning about a lot of things about actual song structure and er, and as far as lyrics are concerned, they're very difficult as far as I'm concerned, I find them quite a task, and er, my strongest point is sort of like say melody content, and um, I basically sort of um, concentrate on that first, the melody, and the song structure, and then the lyrics come afterwards actually 
Yes, well this, this, I thought you had, you'd made a sort of slight mistake earlier on, but this is, this is a track called 'Dear Friends', off our 'Sheer Heart Attack' album, and it's, it's written by Brian, and I've done the vocals on it, but Brian wrote this lovely little tune 
I used to do a lot of um, exercises and weight, weight lifting and all that, and then sort of um, I can't really, because I can't really put pressure on my, my right knee anymore, so therefore I'm sort of limited in the kind of exercises on the weight lifting I do, and one performance on, on a German tour, I actually collapsed, I just did a wrong move, and, and right, right on the front stage, I just, in all spotlights and everything, I just collapsed, and they thought it was part of the show, but of course I couldn't get up again, but as, you know, the show must go on, I, I sort of, I was in agony but I just said I'll, I'll do two more songs but seated at the piano, because at least I can, so they carried me on again, and, and, it was the only time I've actually done this, so at the end of the show, I couldn't take my bow, I was just sat there, because I couldn't move, but I was sat at the piano, I did, I did 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and 'We Are The Champions', and you know the rest of the group had to leave and then straight to hospital 
What our first one? , well the first one was 'Bohemian Rhapsody' 
Not, not, me shy, of course. Yes I am actually, people don't seem to realize that. Just because I go around tearing around on stage, they think I should go tearing around life, but I'm not really 
That does it, you wait 'till you come to the studio next time 
No way, I mean we didn't think that videos would be accepted, you, I mean you don't think in those terms, I mean you don't get up every morning and say 'OK I'm gonna try and set, you know, be completely innovative and, and set a precedent', no you don't do things like that 
No, I really, I really feel that that's worked out really well especially from the orchestration point of view, because he's really used his guitars in a different sort of way, although he's done lots of sort of orchestrations before 
But we're a very difficult group to manage, we demand a lot 
Yes those were the days, it's like I can actually sort of parallel that to sort of, in a way to something that's going on even now, I mean OK when say, um, like Boy George, you see the sort of, you talk about flamboyance and things like that, and I think um, every era or whatever is always gonna have a little bit of that, in those days, it was, it was Queen or something like that, and David Bowie and Roxy Music and we were all sort of, we were trying to put across theatre, because before us was like Eric Clapton and all that, it was all the blues stuff, and people were just, you know, go on there with their jeans and all that, and there had to be a sort of, a backlash, the same way as the Sex Pistols did that to the establishment, and so in a funny way glam rock, with paint and make-up and lots of theatre was a kind of backlash to what was happening before, to be, to be acknowledged, to be accepted 
Twenty pound a week musicians 
Far be it from me to say that, that I don't want to do nothing, and um, people are saying OK now I've done my solo project and they think I'm, I'm actually gonna just stay that way, but no way, I mean I just, I do love working with Queen, and I think the next project is going to be the next Queen album, and, but the only thing I, I did sort of point out to them is that I need a well deserved rest, I mean, I mean, in, in terms of schedule and all, all that, I mean we should be doing a Queen album now, you see, but I mean because I did my solo project, it sort of, I sort of went off on a tangent, and now everything is sort of coming a bit late, and I just said look, for me to do it properly, I, I need a little bit of rest, so I mean I think the next Queen album is scheduled in December 
Well I guess you're right, I mean that's, that's, maybe that is the attraction, but I mean um, in the early days he used to sort of like Queen, and he used to come and see all our concerts, and so we became friends, and he said 'why don't we do something together', this was during, just before the 'Thriller' days, actually, and so I said 'OK we can, why don't we try something together', so it was just me and him, and I went over to his house and did about three or four um, demos, you know, to see how they work out, but I did it in a very different way, I mean it was um, the way he sang it is just so beautiful, and I just said I have to put a different approach to it, so I put, there was more orchestration, and the way that I wanted to do it anyway, maybe he could still sing it 
Now after two years I think er, I think it's gonna be a breath of fresh air, especially for me, my solo project is the other thing, I mean, sort of side by side, I mean doing a tour is one thing, but I'm gonna come back to my solo project, and that, that excites me quite a bit, I was hoping to actually finish it before the tour, but um, yeah, I ran out of time, and so I've got to come back just before Christmas and finish it 
Yeah, that was, oh of course yes. A lot of people have got that sort of twisted round, because I mean they actually thought that we hated synthesisers, it was basically I think we had a guitarist called Brian May who was recreating some amazing sounds through his guitar, and it was basically just informative, really, just information on the album to say that, because people thought my God, you know, guitars don't sound like that, it's got to be a synthesiser, so basically we were just telling the people who bought our records that this was not a synthesiser, and that Brian could recreate these kind of sounds through his wonderful guitar, so it's basically informative, and the moment that we started using synthesisers, we said we do 
I'm sure everybody got that 
I think if I was to sort of analyse, analyse every verse, it would be very boring for the listeners, and it might sort of shatter a few illusions , I'd rather sort of kept it 
Yes dear, see you then 
You want a few trade secrets? It was quite a mammoth task, because it was basically done in three, three definite sections and just pieced together, and each one required a lot of concentration, the opera section, the middle, was the most taxing I think, 'cos er, we just, we wanted to recreate a sort of huge operatic sort of um, harmony section, between just the three of us, and that involves a lot of multi-tracking and things, and I think between the three of us we sort of, we recreated a, a sort of hundred and sixty to two hundred piece  choir effect between just the three of us, that's Brian, Roger and myself just singing it 
One of them ended up as 'State Of Shock' which in the end I couldn't complete, I couldn't finish, so Mick Jagger did it  yeah, that's true, so I mean I actually did the vocals, but the thing is, this is the thing, timing is everything, you know, and um, at the time when he wanted me to finish it, I just said I can't, because I was working with Queen, I said I really haven't got time, I was in Munich, he was in Los Angeles, and he said, 'look is it OK if Mick does it?', I said fine, so Mick did my vocals, and so I think all that remains is, is a track that we actually wrote together, and um, it's a track called 'Victory', which then he used the title as, as The Jackson's album, so it was before that, so I mean, in, in, in a funny way I guess, that track is frozen, because um, we, that's, the only track that we actually wrote together as it were and so we've, we've got a demo, which sounds great 
I socialise, definitely, I socialise, I meet people as long as they realise it's nothing to do with work, 'cos I mean, which I like, I like the hustle and bustle of life 
Oh yes, in terms of shock, outrage and being accepted, that's the way, you just, and the music was there aswell, but I think music is not enough, I mean you say talent will out, but I mean these days talent consists of, of more than just being able to write a good song, I mean you have to deliver it, you have to sort of package it, and you have to be there at the right time and just, you have to sort of take in all these ingredients, I think 
I've never let the press worry me, I mean in the early days you, you think about it and go out and buy the papers and make sure that you're in it and all that, and um, now it's, it's a completely different setup because it's, it's your music, and basically what you worry about is, is the people that buy your product, that's what keeps us going 
What a nice little chap here 
I've sort of chosen an Aretha Franklin track, I think it's called 'You've Got A Friend', it's from the er, 'Amazing Grace' album which she did a long time ago, it's a live sort of thing, double album set, it's a sort of gospel thing that she did live in a, in a church in California I think, it's called 'You've Got A Friend' 
I don't get up every morning and rush to the mirror and see how many lines I've got, I mean that's the best way to do it as far as I'm concerned, I don't worry, because I mean if you're gonna get old, or you look, that's the way it is, no matter facelifts or whatever, no matter how many creams you use on the, it's just not, it's just not me, you know, it's just not me, and, and I know the kind of life I lead sometimes when I'm on these late nights and everything, I, I can get by with like two or three hours sleep a night, and I'm fine 
But of course dear, it travels with me everywhere 
I just hate talking to people about myself basically, I, when I talk to people I like to talk about, about them, and um, more interesting things actually. 
Yes, he does those, very versatile 
Yes, I've multi tracked myself on this one 
Yes, it's, it's sort of very out of, out of the sort of Queen format really, and we always like to do that every album, and I think I went a bit mad on this one I know, but it's, it's um, it's turned out alright I think, you know, it sort of makes people laugh sometimes 
Ahh, very sort of briefly, Brian and Roger they were in a sort of very up-tempo, raucous band called Smile, and I used to be in another band um, called Wreckage, or something 
Winds light, force two or three, well this is the way you've written it, it's in code, my God, two or three mostly west to northwest, becoming south to south west later 
It's, it's just um, a figment of your imagination 
I've actually broken it three times, but it's not broken, I think broken is the wrong thing, I've just torn my ligament, which I think is worse sometimes, so it's nothing to do with bones, it's just my ligaments in the right knee. 
Yes it's called 'News Of The World' 
I enjoy it, and find it harder, actually. It depends who you're working with but um, I mean I, I love that challenge, I love that challenge, because it's um, and I think all the other Queen members would actually tell you that, because um, we now worked, we have been working together for so long, and we know each other instinctively what to do, do you know what I mean? 
With David Bowie, when we did that thing, that was exactly that way, we didn't, we didn't plan anything or whatever, he just happened to be in town, we're friends, and he just kept popping into the studio and we were, we were jamming to some of his songs and, and ours and we had a few bottles of wine and, and things and we suddenly said 'why don't we try something totally new', and out  this, this song. 
Those were, those were the days of sixteen track studios and I think, wasn't it, that was done in , we have, you have now twenty four and thirty two track, but I mean as we did so many overdubs, I mean on sixteen track, it was like, we just kept piling it on and on, and it was like that's what Roger means that the tape went transparent, because it just couldn't take anymore. 
Yes, it's um, it's a very fine dividing line really, because we want to put in more music, but at the same time you've got to make sure you don't put too much otherwise it suffers, and then that's where all the, it's a very fine dividing line, as I said 
Yeah, they're nice, yes, I'm really very pleased with them 
Well, you want, which, which tracks you mean? Well that's, that's one of his and um, 'Tie Your Mother Down' was Brian's, he's written a lovely sort of Japanese song, which is at the end of the second side, it's got sort of Japanese verses, which took a lot  yes, actual Japanese verses which we had to do, we did a lot of research actually and had um, our, our interpreter, Japanese interpreter, we flew her over from Japan 
Yes I think one must definitely invest, that's what my accountant says, I for one have sort of started up a little production company of my own, and have signed to it a person called Peter Straker, so that's a little venture that I've sort of got myself into, you know, alongside Queen, which is obviously the major thing 
Oh. He's just put it in my lap, I can't believe it. Weather for the Capital area. 
Oh yes  all the time 
I'm looking forward to this tour, the only thing that I'm worried about is, is, to be honest is, is my legs, I mean I sort of, you know I had a bit of a mishap with it about two months ago, there are certain things I don't, I don't think I can do that, and I like to be sort of a hundred percent fit when I'm doing these things, and I'm just worried because there's going to be times where I'm, if I move too fast or whatever, it just seems to sort of snap. 
Things that are more relevant, I feel anyway, and they're the, you can tell that they've done sort of their homework because they ask you very penetrating questions, which I don't mind, but you know they have some substance because then when they're, when they write about it, they sort of, it has much more bearing, but over here, it's all you know 'why have you stopped wearing black fingernails' or whatever, and that's the review, that's the review 
Thank you very much 
Yes, because I, because I like them, it's what I've been interested for a long while, and now that I've got a little bit of money to throw around I thought I might as well go and buy it. 
Well, at that time no, because I was, I was in semi professional bands and things, and in the end I mean I just took the plunge and I said that's exactly what I want to do, and I think that's the only way to approach this business, is that you sort of take, you can't sort of do it in half measures, you really can't, you can't say 'OK I'm gonna give it a couple of years and if doesn't happen...', because if you have that in the back of your mind, I don't think you're gonna give it your, all your energies anyway, and I was quite prepared to starve, which I did anyway, and, and just make a go of this, and nothing else. 
I did, well I did have um, in my youth, that's a couple of years ago, I um, no, when, when I was about seven years old, I had piano lessons, and I did up to grade 4 classical, practical and theory, and then I gave it up, because um, I basically sort of play by ear really, and I couldn't, I can't sight read at all, so I gave that up anyway, and now all my sort of playing is done by ear. 
I, I refused to play the damn thing 
Yes, yes he does 
He's a tart, but he's no fool 
But we are going to America for a tour 
But I think um, because I talk so much anyway, he likes to let me do all the talking, but I mean, once um, people sort of crack that thin ice, then he's alright, you know, you can never stop him talking then 
Yes and no, there's bound to be people saying yeah that sounds like Queen and that, but I mean I'm not afraid of that, it's just that I want a batch of songs that sound good, good, or good enough, and the way I choose them, and um, to the best of my capabilities I'm, I'm, I'm gonna do a solo album 
Oh, God, you should never ask me that. They're basically um, my sort of lyrics are sort of basically for people's interpretations really, I mean I think it's, I've forgotten what they were all about 
I think it snapped in about two places 
Oh, clear, it's your, it's your writing. Clear spells, clean spells, yes I. Clear spells this evening, cold high three or four centigrade 
No, another fictitious person 
Things like that, and we sort of work in, also we, in indi-, as far as the individual song is concerned, and also what will go with, how the songs will sort of sound with each other, so it's basically sort of, looking in terms of an album, as opposed to just individual songs 
So I went to Sotheby's the other day, and got a few paintings. The dealers weren't pleased at all 
Yes, as far as we're concerned, we're putting on a show, it's not just, just us, just not another rendition of, of an album, we might, if that was the case, we might as well just have sort of cardboard cut-outs and just play the album, through, through the sort of system 
I think after thirteen years or whatever I just think people know just about everything about me, and so basically I'm just saying the same old things, you know, after thirteen years and I think it's not very interesting to be honest, talking about myself, but there you are 
I played piano and basically, God I don't know how we sort of managed to stay this sort of simple you know, what with our overdubs and things. 
In London, , in London, have a nice dinner, that's basically what 
It depends on who's 
By all means go out and buy that again, I'm, I'm, I'm not complaining 
Yes, it can skip and do all kinds of things 
When I'm on tour or whatever, I just go to the best restaurants that money can afford, but just to sample all kinds, oh yes 
I think they're wonderful 
I mean, I remember when I was writing 'Bohemian Rhapsody', I had a song called 'We Are The Champions', but I just didn't feel that it fitted at the time, and, and I just sort of kept it aside and it's virtually I think about two or three years later that I sort of, you know, pulled it out the bag again and there you are, so you, you can never tell 
Come and see my gallery  now they call it a museum but 
It's the most egotistical and arrogant song I've ever written , you know 
Um, it's just because I mean I've come through art college and things like that, and I just, I basically liked the sort of artist, and I sort of liked the painting, and I thought I'd like to sort of write a song about it 
So this is pretty sparse actually by Queen standards 
Well, this, this one is um, a track written by Brian actually, I dunno why. I think he was sort of, one of his vicious moods  I think he's trying to out do me after 'Death On Two Legs' actually 
I think I'm, I feel I'm getting better every year, don't you? 
I'd eat all kinds of things, all kinds of things, I have, I have a gourmet chef that works for me, so I'm, I'm absolutely spoilt in terms of food, and, and, and he just makes up all kinds of exotic um, delicacies and then most of the time he doesn't even tell me so I mean I just um, yes I'm very spoilt in terms of that, yes. 
I think we've got to a stage where, where we will do whatever we want and I think um that's the best way of doing it, because I hate to conform and pander to even public tastes or as far as record company people are concerned, I mean it, it's, because I, in fact I was thinking about that a couple of days ago in terms of, and I thought my God we were, we were outrageous and innovative in the days of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', and that's why it worked, for us to start pandering to people's tastes and saying that, that this is what they want would be such a backlash, or in terms of, my God, I mean that's what we did before, and that's how we made it, and that's how we're gonna actually stay, and so we're gonna do things against the grain, and against people's ideas or whatever, and if they like it, they like it, but we're not afraid of the fact that, that we're doing things, it's like we don't jump on the bandwagon or, OK this is, this is, this is modern or whatever, let's do it, no, we do it with the Queen stamp on everything, but we're aware, we're not stupid, I mean we don't just churn out the same stuff that we did like five or six years ago, we're aware, that's, we're in tune to what, what's going on, and, and that's the way I, I, I like to live, so I mean, I remember we had an album called 'Hot Space' which, which died a death in America, and everybody said 'oh, yes, Queen took um, a big risk, now they'll know that's not what, what they should do', and in fact I said 'if that's what I want to do, I'll do it' 
No, I, I think it's, basically what he's trying to say is that there was a desired effect really, and 
We are really, actually 
Freddie on 'Saturday Live' with Graham Neale, 'The Works' album, BBC Radio 1 
Well the sleeve had a sort of crest on it, didn't it, that's right, sort of 
That's one of the softer tracks 
They're tinny and horrible, I don't like them  why play those things when you've got a lovely super grand piano? 
He was just a beautiful man, I think he was just a master showman, what can I say, he was just a dedicated musician, I mean he was just everything as far as I was concerned and I went to numerous places to sort of try and catch his shows, just magic, just magic, and it was really, it's quite sort of a treat to watch somebody just come on the stage, I mean he didn't have the kind of props and things that we have today, it all emitted from him, you know, from, from the person, it was just him and the guitar, very colourful, and just um, it was quite a stage act, you, you learnt a lot from that kind of thing 
That to me was a bigger challenge, and these are the songs that I wrote, and I think my solo album, it's like a sort of, an extension of 'Hot Space' to be honest 
No, I wasn't upset, I mean there's, the reason I'm talking about this is, I'm saying that there are, there will always be some people who are gonna be disillusioned by the fact that, um, that the video is not cohesive with the song in terms, in terms of what they wanted to see 
You have to believe in it, and I just believed in it and I just said it doesn't matter how long it takes, um, I'm going to do this, and you have to have a certain amount of confidence and arrogance and all that, you know, and your egos have to be there aswell, you know, you can't be a nice guy in this business, and I think over the years, through experience and everything, you really get, you get into this situation where you put all your defences up, which I normally wouldn't want to do, but I mean you just have to, otherwise you get broken down, and it's, it's so easy to be trodden on, that you have to be hardened to the fact very early on, so you know how to, you just have, it's like playing dodgems really, it's rock 'n' roll dodgems, you just have to sort of dodge those fears at all times and, and the higher up the ladder you go, the, the more problems you get and the harder it becomes, and so there are even bigger pitfalls, but I mean that's what you sort of aim for really, it's the ultimate, you know that's your goal, so I mean, I'm not sort of asking for sympathy or anything, I'm just saying that's what it's all about and if anybody wants to embark on it, don't, it's not an easy escalator to success, I tell you 
There were times when I'd love to do shows where they were just screaming and howling all the time, and you could just play anything, just because you've got the adulation, now I, I would prefer them to, to listen to what we're playing, but still have a damn good time, you know 
I even sort of write songs, in terms of Queen, I know exactly what the bass player's capable of, and things like that, so that's, I'm intuned before I, I even write a song, knowing fully well what they're gonna do, but to work with an established artist, not knowing him, then you're just, you're sort of, you're working from stage one, you know, and, and that's, that's a great challenge because, so you don't know which way to write, and you don't know what kind of aggression you're gonna get, what kind of um, complement you're gonna get, you know, what kind of rapport you're gonna get, so sometimes I think that working with other people, the best way is to just go in there and just do it, if it sparks, if it sparks off you've got it, otherwise you just forget it 
Well it depends, it depends, um, well I mean, I don't take much notice to be honest of the musical trade actually, they can say what they like 
I'm getting a bit worried actually. He's sort of quiet, to lots of people he seems, don't underestimate him, he's um, he's got a bit of, he's got a fiery streak underneath all that, really. 
In a way I just don't wanna let people down, and I don't wanna let the rest of the group down, and myself, because I mean I know the things that are expected of me, and um, I mean I'd love my leg to be, you know, a hundred percent, but I just, maybe it's just me being a bit paranoid, maybe after the first couple of nights I'll be alright 
I'm a bit of everything. I am actually, that, that's what it takes to be honest, I, I, I can sit here and say I'm a wonderful person, it's a combination of a lot of ingredients, actually you know, I can be a real bitch, but I think in the public eye, you see, what, what's been um, put across of course is my stage persona which, which is very arrogant, very aggressive, or whatever, and that sort of comes into light, and whenever people want to talk about me, or when they see me in public, they just, they're attuned to what they see and they just think I'm arrogant or whatever, and, and in one way that's nice, because I don't want everyone to know about my real inner feelings, because that's my private life, I think, so I think there are very few people, basically people who I call very close friends, who actually know the other side of me, so I mean, you know, the last thing I want, and the papers will never write about the fact that 'oh look he's real nice underneath it' and things like that, you know. 
London I find very, um, I find it frightening, with, I think it's the familiarity of it all, it's where we started and everything, and I like playing there, but I hate it at the same time 
You're gonna be very surprised, it cost between three and five thousand pounds 
It's a survival test, you know, and I mean of course we could all just go away and say OK we've had enough and live happily ever after, but I mean I don't think that's what we're in, we're in it to make music, and er, the way I think, well what else could I do, I mean this is the thing that interests me most. 
You don't know what it means to, when you write a song which people actually appreciate, and they say it's a good song, it's a, it's a wonderful feeling , it's a wonderful feeling 
Yes, that's right 
Somebody said this was like a Cecil B. DeMille um, meets Walt Disney, or something, which is the more to the point than say The Beach Boys 
They've probably all got their copies now anyway, so we might as well play something else 
But there are two sides to me, you know, I think there's many sides to, to most people 
Freddie Mercury 
Champagne everybody 
Not, not constructive at all actually. The American press I find much more, I feel that they do their homework and the kind of questions they ask you makes much better copy anyway 
People think we're sort of over complex, and it's not true, it depends on, it depends on, on the individual track really, if it needs it, we do it. 
Freddie with Kenny Everett, 'A Day At The Races' album, Capital Radio 
Ah, there you have it, and I think um, I've found a place, which is called Munich, where I can actually walk the streets, I mean Munich is like a little village really, I mean I have a lot of friends over there, and they, they know who I am or whatever, but they just treat me as another human being, and they've accepted me that way, and that to me is, is a very good way of relaxing, because I, I don't want to sort of relax and sort of shut myself up, that's not what I want, because I'd go, I'd go spare, I'd go mad even quicker, it's just, it's just that I like to feel that I can sort of do exactly the same kind of things like socialise and have parties and whatever, because that, but not having the burden of knowing fully well that, oh my God, tomorrow, I mean I can't stay up too late because tomorrow I have a, a meeting, or I have a, I have a commitment, or, or, or I have to do a show, I mean if, if I completely remove myself from that, I can still be in the same town, and just, and that's my way of relaxing 
I think it was, it was, we wanted something released to coincide with the tour that we were doing at the time, and as we didn't have any new product, 'cos I mean we were, the way we did it this time was we did a tour and then we were going to go in the studio and do the new album, which is 'News Of The World' 
That was afterwards I think 
Oh, Mike Stone's pretty good, yes, that little bugger 
But this is not to say that we're always right, because we're not  the choice of single is  , is a very difficult thing, I mean, there's no sure fire hit, you know, there's just, there's no such thing, and with say something like 'Bohemian Rhapsody', it was a big risk, and it worked, because I think with a song like that it was either gonna be a huge success or a, or a terrific flop, and you know it was 
Actually I did this one by myself, I multi tracked myself. So the others weren't used on this for the voices. 
If you're talking about videos, and we might aswell, it's big business now anyway, and it's a very good way of, of showcasing yourself, but there are moments in videos where I think, um, the buyer can be misguided, because I, I remember the times when, if you like a piece of music, you go out and buy it, and you sort of conjure up a thing for yourself, and you think oh that's the kind of emotion or whetever he's, he's putting up, so I mean each individual can create his own feeling from that song, but the moment you make a video, they see it and they say 'oh my God, I, I take it that's the way he wants to put it across', so I mean it really narrows you down, and, and sometimes I like to sort of lose myself in videos and, and make it as free as possible, so that there are lots of elements, especially when a song is very emotional and it's a love song, in fact only the other day somebody came up to me and told me exactly that, he said 'I'd had a pre-concieved idea of what I thought you were telling me in the song, but when I saw your video I knew I was totally wrong', you see 
Even more up-tempo, and we used to be friends, I mean, you know, going to college together and sort of met up, and after sort of couple of years of knowing each other we just decided um, we'd form a band together really, as simple as that, we thought our musical ideas would um, blend, and then we met John, and decided to call the band Queen 
Freddie on 'Newsbeat', 'The Works' tour, BBC Radio 1 
Yes, it's called 'Good Old Fashioned Loverboy', and it's in my sort of ragtime sort of mood that I sort of get a chance to, to do on every album and yes 
Oh it's great, it's great, , I've got a copy of that 
I think I was doing virtually, very similar stuff to say what Boy George is doing, but I think it's much harder for him now, because I mean, you know shock value, and, and being outrageous is, you, it takes more to outrage-, outrage people now, because um 
I remember David half way through it said 'my God, I mean it's catchy, it's caught fire, I mean let's, let's take it', so suddenly it then became a sort of um, a worthwhile project, before we were just fooling around and we said 'let's grab this while it's happening, because if we come back tomorrow, we will probably go our separate ways and, and not think about it', so we just carried on, it was virtually like a twenty four hour session, we just kept at it and finally got the, the crux of the song and then when we knew that was gonna do something we sort of worked on it another day and then finished it 
It's dry with long sunny periods, clean spells this evening, cold high 
Yes, we've, sort of um, he's no fool this one 
We have, in America we have, we have a limousine each, and we just, the moment we finish, just get into that, and do our own bit 
Oh I'd say that dear, easily 
Yes, more sort of 
So if Mary, Mary Potts, Mary Potts has got a little dancette, then it'll just go flying off 
Actually that was... 
Well, that's quite easy, , same as you do. I don't know, I just sort of, you just have to work at it, you know, and after a while you sort of fall into a pattern, and um, experience. 
But from the very sort of beginning, I think as far as the musical press are concerned, I mean they, they like, I mean even now they like to sort of, put sort of up and coming bands into a sort of particular bag for, for what they think, and I think we sort of just rebelled, I mean we wanted to sort of do what we thought was right and not sort of go along with what they were saying, and I think since the very early stages, we've, there's always been this sort of um, fracas between us and the press 
After five, six albums, I think a lot of areas have opened up, and they're sort of, there are lots of things that one can do, and I think already we're sort of branching out and doing other things, just, just for mere 
You know in, in terms of that, I mean especially now the rest of the group actually sort of, will sort of take my view on this in that we don't give a damn, what, what, we do what we want to do, and it's either accepted or not 
Especially now, there are so many, I mean you get posters 
It's really fictitious, I know it's like sort of bowing out or some easy way out, but that's basically what it is. 
Squeeze is right 
No, it's, it's, it's tougher, it makes it, makes life much more difficult, but, but I think it's good in the long run because, in one way it, it takes the strain away from you, because I mean you don't have to write all the time, the same time you have to sort of, it's a battle because I mean sometimes you can have a, a batch of very good songs, but you still have to sift through and there's a big fight between which song goes on, and all that, so there's lots of temperamental situations, but you can never say, you know sometimes you probably er, miss out a very good song. 
Because I mean like there was a section of 'no, no, no', and we had to sort of do that in sort of different escalating things and we just sat there going  'no, no, no, no, no, no, no' about, I don't know, a hundred and fifty times 
Yes, we, we're not scared of trying out different ideas, you know, I think one of the things that we really steer clear of is trying to sort of repeat the same formula, write different ideas 
I have a lot of ideas that are bursting to get out 
That's what I'm all about, I guess, but I think the way um, people get news, is, is whenever something goes wrong, I mean, that's, that's, that's newsworthy isn't it, so I mean over the past six months or whatever it's either I've broken my leg, I lost my voice in South Africa or um, something's happened, and you know it does take it's toll, I mean I um, I have been working very hard, I was doing my solo project and I was also working with Queen, so basically I was sort of undertaking two very sort of heavy projects simultaneously, and that does sort of take it's toll, I mean I was really exhausted, because normally what happens, I mean if, if I do an album with Queen, OK, we, we go into studios and you know we work, you know day and night or whatever, and then you have a rest period, and then you go on tour, but I had to sort of do it in between times, and there were so many times when I had to, to stop working and do things with Queen, like even if it's a video, or do the odd show or whatever, but then the moment I finished my solo project, I mean I had to go on, on actual tour with Queen, so I had to go to sort of Australia and Japan, and I didn't have enough time in between to actually sort of think about things like that, so I was just embarking on all kinds of things, you know like press receptions and things, which I hate doing anyway 
We shut shop in his honour 
Well it's, that's a good question, it's, it's a, it's basically self discipline, really, the budget was endless and we used to spend enormous amount of time and money in saying we've got to get it right, but now I, I like to work the other way, I have, there's enough money to make me, you know, I, I, I could be in a studio for a year, but I hate that, I like to make decisions early, it's, it's discipline, it's discipline
