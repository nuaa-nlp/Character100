There's a lot of cheese being delivered on that pizza right there.
And it's gonna be at the end of—towards the end of the year.
So we're not gonna—
And so I wanted to wait. I wanted to go to Hawaii. I wanted it to be special.
Thank you so much. I did.
There wasn't a lot of suffering, thankfully, but—
And then what he did, he would take—he would take credit for everything.
I live—we have a farm in Virginia. Happily to say I moved my family here to Atlanta.
I have a tequila surprise for you. And it's coming out.
And I ran into the bedroom. I said, I'm kidding. You're my Gayle.
And I thank you. Truly. Thank you.
Like we have two properties. That way—
But I also told you, I'm unattached. You don't even have to text me back. Right?
My workout today was I did chest and I did back.
Yes. Because I didn't get that.
I was the strong, silent type.
I'm sure she'll be down with that.
"Of course I taught him everything I know." Yeah.
—not one person. You suck.
Yeah, thank you.
We're gonna shorten it. I'll be called The Rock. And here we go.
As I would, yours.
I was right there, yeah. Bring it on. I mean, this is our moment.
She did. Yes. Yes.
My Rolex. And I'm supposed to be in the moment and wrestling these other guys. Oh, no.
And it is going to you. And I'm gonna pour us just a sip.
Okay. So—all right. The first thing I splurged on.
Look, here's the thing. I've got—okay, we've got work to do. That was so funny.
And I went and I got myself a Rolex. And I wore it. At that time, I was wrestling.
It's way more than just physicality.
We got married—we got married very early. I've got to work out. That's the thing.
And I'll never forget. We were on I-75. He lived in Tampa.
Yes. Well, I know you're a big tequila fan and we are. We started a spirits company.
I still have that in my head, you know. But it keeps you grounded by the way.
Nothing. I had to work up in Canada in the Canadian Football League.
And good people around as well.
Like I really appreciate the little things.
I'm gonna tell you I love you every day. I'm gonna text you I love you.
And when in unison—
And I look at you. I love you. And I'm gonna text you.
Because at that time the biggest movie stars in the world were George Clooney.
It's not real. That didn't happen.
Thank you, Oprah. And cheers.
Um, I— I am. I'm not super strict. But discipline is important.
But, yeah, maybe a musical one day.
So your dad taught you a lot. I wonder, what have your daughters taught you?
This is what not to do. So I thought, this is it. I'm gonna splurge.
That was a big thing, too, was just the power of empathy—
Especially at that young age.
Like your friend Brene Brown, who I love—
Myself? No. Tom Hanks.
No pain. No anger. No complication.
Yes. It's almost like a physical soap opera. And I always say with wrestling—
I have today. Yes. In this—yes.
I'm most—gratitude is a big thing with me. I mean, it is truly my—my anchor.
I'm honored that you're a fan. And backstage you look 20 years younger. Give me a hug.
So we do a lot of fishing.
It's such a power in thing.
I do. I'll tell you a funny story about this. And I was gonna show you the text.
It just gives such perspective.
And—but, again, it's the cycle of life. And it's beautiful. It's painful.
I mean, right there.
—we talk about this.
It was just—marriage wasn't in our cards. Great friends. Marriage wasn't in our cards.
I love you back. I truly do.
16,000 people were chanting: Rocky sucks.
I mean, maybe there were 10 adults. Ten people. That was it.
It's incredible. It's all these things. And I will tell you this.
And I thought, well, what if I lose?
Thank you. It means a lot. Thank you very much.
I have two. I was once married and now I'm happily married. Lauren is back there.
Because when I said to him, I want to get into the professional wrestling business.
One hundred percent.
It's way more than just picking up a weight. It is my balance. It's my anchor.
I will. I promise. Thank you, guys.
To be able to get it out. Especially publicly. And talk publicly, too, about it.
Yes. Extremely scary.
There's a reverb that happens in the arena.
It's a powerful thing.
A challenged father. But a great friend to so many people. So he went quick.
So my father, for a lot of you guys who don't know, he was a professional wrestler.
It was a Rolex watch.
Played at the University of Miami. We had a great——thank you. Great teams.
We do. We have a special thing coming to Atlanta. It's called Athleticon.
So it would be my wife, Lauren.
She's working so hard.
It broke. Live TV. And you see me, oh, my gosh.
And the dream didn't come true. I didn't get drafted. I didn't get any offers.
Where's Erik? Erik, where are you, Erik?
—and receive so much love.
And I love this question. What still surprises you the most about people?
She's the sweetest woman. Okay. Okay.
I was being groomed as a good guy wrestler. Young. The idea was, you're grateful.
Yes. She's called my wife. Yes.
And it was crippling for me.
I was right there.
Gratitude for what I was able to have with him.
I was just renting. Horrible financial—
Therapy really helped me.
I love you, too. Thank you, mom. I would love to—I'd love to—where's Erik?
This time in my life.
I have a new relationship with you.
Um—yeah, who sucks now, huh?
In their hearts, they're good.
Bang, capital letters: "Nick is not your Gayle."
It's great for the ego. It's wonderful. I think that—
I need to talk about this. I need to talk about my issues. My fears.
Digging. It's that mentality to really take advantage of every opportunity I have.
Thank you. That was fun. With Lin-Manuel Miranda.
So for those who said, we don't get it, kind of sweet revenge.
Oh, it was so good. And her face changed and then—okay. Okay.
Thank you. I did. I needed this.
What's up, Atlanta? Thank you, Oprah, for having me. Thank you, guys.
So I still had to follow my gut.OPRAH: Yeah.
This is in the WWE.
And how important that is.
Came to Miami. Got in his pickup truck. We drove up I-75.
Because it gives you such an appreciation for what you have now.
Yes. Yes, you do.
Thank you for laughing. But it was—
Oh, sure. Very important. People I have around me and how important that is.
So I held everything in. Plus I was an only child. And—
It's a very powerful thing.
Come up here, brother.
So, again, horrible. I leave, I go in the kitchen. I'm eating.
And you know what? This is who I'm gonna be. And then here I am today.
Absolutely. I had to say hello to you.
Oh, thank you. I do all right. Thank you.
She turns around. And I said, will you marry me? It was wonderful.
And he said, look around. This is what I have. I don't have anything.
That's one of those great moments.
No, it doesn't have to be ugly.
We've got good mana here. And that's what it is. It's very powerful.
I saw it. Yes.
I did those things. I did the things like—
Yes. It's completely changing. It's been a long time overdue.
It was beautiful.
This tequila is called—
And she's, like, sure. Sure. Sure.
So on raw, live TV. I grabbed the microphone. And I said, I may be a lot of things.
—and what that feeling—
The rent was $180 a week.
And I don't want that for you.
Just me and you.
He is not your Gayle. With 10 exclamation points.
I will. Yes. And this is a sipping tequila.
