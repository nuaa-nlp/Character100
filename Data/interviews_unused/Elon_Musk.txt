So there’s no mine.
Outside Twitter?
Or we’ll get feedback.
Actually, no. It just was unevenly enforced.
I should. I shouldn’t, I shouldn’t.
Yeah. Was kind of bad, actually.
Yeah, yeah. Totally. Exactly.
The point at which you say that this is… Who is starting to decide that?
Okay. And is James invited too? Well, it doesn’t really matter because-
Or that it’s desperately needed for Twitter.
You literally can’t name one.
It’s not top secret.
Like some people around here. This is a dangerous type of work we’re in.
Yeah, maybe I will.
vote or something.
Has BBC changed its COVID misinformation?
No, I think that’s a big factor.
I just want to say I like BBC.
Okay. Well, thanks for .
I need bulletproof shoes at this point.
I think it was something that needed to be done.
Really? Yes. Really.
Yeah, something like that.
So overall, I think the trend is very good.
I know. It was so good, we keep going.
Well, I kind of had to.
Well, I thought, “Wow, this is a really nice office building.” And…
That was around late December, early January.
In my whole life?
Has BBC changed the Covid misinformation?
It’s going to be… It’s not going to hit the bullseye.
Yeah, he’s got great instincts.
It’s one of the hardest things, certainly. Yeah.
I guess more Elizabeth Holmes.
Yeah. My father never owned a… So you’re thinking of an emerald mine.
You’re most welcome. All right, thanks. Signing off guys.
That’s absurd.
We’re headed into a weird world here.
I’m not aware of that particular situation.
Wow. There’s 680,000 people listening.
No, it wasn’t. He actually the thing-
He’s got a black turtleneck, what more do you need?
Yes. Whatever you want to talk about.
Okay. Well, why don’t you use For You? What’s wrong with it?
First of all, we do have people  content moderation. It’s not like we don’t.
So there are limits to speech.
No. In fact, they wouldn’t even let us take the W off the sign.
Yeah. Publicly funded. Basically we’re trying to be as accurate as possible.
Okay. It’s a long list. It’s a long list.
Honestly, Twitter is troll heaven.
This is Elon Musk interviewing the BBC.
We’re trying to be accurate.
Okay. What would you do?
I think in the grand scheme of things, the BBC does aspire to be accurate.
Okay. How do you unmute?
Yeah, if the building owner lets us, we will do it.
I don’t know. We could just let people stay there. It’s nice.
I believe you can.
No, my dog, Floki, is the CEO.
We were quite-
You can’t name a single example.
I did stand down.
Oh, you thought it wasn’t?
Following is just who you follow. It’s not algorithm, it’s just-
So it’s mostly just like, let’s just move on to the future.
Then I say, sir, that you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Yeah, it’ll swim just fine.
Well, you’re getting favorable treatment right now.
I can hear you.
Cue a whole bunch of court cases.
What hate speech are you talking about? I mean, you use Twitter.
That was a stetted argument.
I’m really just scrolling as fast as I can here.
Is that’s actually not true.
The batting average of Community Notes I found to be extremely high.
Really? Are you serious?
I think it was around just under 8,000. We’re about 1,500 right now.
Then how do you know that-
It doesn’t exist. It’s fake.
I think I should not tweet after 3: 00 AM.
Well, I don’t really believe in patents actually because-
Yeah, we should do something about the crime.
Yeah. Well, yeah, I would recommend adding the W for the SRTs.
You’d be like, “Huh, that’s not what you said.”
No. The point is that you won’t be.
Okay. Doge Designer, if you unmute, you can talk.
Well, fortunately, it didn’t in the trial.
Yeah. I’d like to see a picture of the alleged emerald mine.
Anyway, they’re still alive and well, so they’re doing fine.
If we’re not there, we’ll be there soon.
And you can’t give us a single one.
Yeah, it’s amazing. And actually, even the AI fashion is great.
Then how could you see the hateful content?
I was looking for questions. You got any questions?
No. But, well, you might still have an idea.
You just lied.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Twitter is an accelerant to X the everything.
She’s got a husky voice and a black turtleneck. Problem solved.
All right. Thank you.
Well, we have all time high usage, so I don’t think it has been.
Well, I guess you’ll have to stay tuned to find out.
No, I’m talking about the BBC’s misinformation about COVID.
Yeah. Well, maybe 2 AM.
Yes. Who is the arbiter?
I mean we’re literally on Twitter right now.
Yes. So I’ll keep us here I guess.
Good. How’s it going?
But no, I don’t have a burner or anything like that. Yeah, never have had.
Total hate speech.
Jump in, the water’s warm. It’s great.
Biggest crisis, yeah.
Yeah, real realtime doxing of locations is not okay.
I sometimes sleep in the office. In the library.
By the building owner.
So the actual CPU usage or computer usage is dramatically less.
So I sleep there sometimes.
Yeah, the dog’s the CEO. What are you complaining about? It’s great dog.
It was crazy how viral that picture of the Pope with the awesome jacket-
People are dying.
It’s not super complicated.
Do I tap it again?
Yeah, it’s a hard job.
Yeah. Not fun at all. It’s painful.
No, I think it’s great. It’s way better. Better by a lot.
Are you aware of that?
What hate speech are you talking about? I mean, you use Twitter?
Yeah, it’s true.
If you can’t recognize them, then it’s not a thing.
Possibly, yeah.
Yeah. It’s unique.
Content you don’t like, or hateful. Describe a hateful thing?
No, it’s just realtime doxing is not allowed.
Let’s hear from Doge Designer. Okay, so what do I do?
They’re deciding what to write an article about.
Look, I held a pole and there was a strong yes on Titter, removing the W.
That is our goal.
That’s why we’re so focused on it.
And yet you claimed that the hateful content was high. That’s false.
So you think if it’s something is slightly sexist it should be banned?
There is something more to it.
Not yet. No, this place is nice and I kind of like this office actually.
Yes. We’re going to ask for a refund.
Yeah. We would like to do it right now.
He’s taken over.
Oh, fair enough.
We’re clearly a well-oiled machine here.
Give me one example.
Yes. That is the reason.
You’re in. Okay.
Which is, it isn’t quite going out of fashion yet.
It’s been very effective.
Insert Mark Twain saying, “Rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.”
That’s for sure.
So you think if something as slightly sexist it should be banned?
He was using non-public information combined with public information.
Yeah. Why can’t we be an  commune?
Yeah, right. This is…
Yeah, they won’t let us.
Wow, 3 million?
Do you agree that that has occurred?
Yeah, totally.
It’s very alert, and it’s hard to get anything by him.
Exactly. Wait, is my audio coming through? Just checking.
Is that what you’re saying?
I mean in the, sorry, Following.
Not For You because it’s not, frankly.
You see more hate speech personally?
I literally follow the BBC on Twitter.
But the W is now a background color, so…
You literally can’t give me one.
You’re not buying the stuff that’s broken.
Yes, I do. Yeah. So there’s a lot going on.
Yes, where they are.
And you can’t give a single one.
That was amazing.
Then how would you know there’s hateful content?
That’s why I’m asking for examples. Can you name one example?
So that’s why we’re being so rigorous in this regard.
Do I look uncomfortable? Actually, I do. I look uncomfortable.
Do you like BBC?
I do find it funny.
Wow. Okay. We’ve got 200,000 people listening.
It’s a great dog.
Do you like the BBC? Do you like BBC?
We should take action.
Meanwhile, there’s like murders running free, so it’s crazy.
Only dog haters would be opposed to making the dog a CEO.
Have I shot myself under foot with tweets multiple times? Yes.
Who do you think that might be?
No, I’m talking about the BBC’s misinformation about Covid.
No, but he never owned a emerald mine. This is total bullshit.
Come on. Surely you like BBC. Come on.
Oh, you’re welcome.
Then how would you know if there’s hateful content?
When they tweet.
Then I say so that you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Where trying to figure out what’s real is super hard.
Okay. Why? Because it sort of gives an ambiance or something?
I’m not CEO anymore.
Why do you even need a CEO? You don’t really need a CEO.
So I get a lot of negative feedback.
Okay, sure. Just shoot me a note.
I’m interviewing you too.
Great. Fire away.
It’s been good to get negative feedback.
Not yet. Hopefully at some point.
Okay. I don’t see you listed as a speaker.
They can bring their stuff, bring their tent and whatever.
Number will never leave me.
It’s intense. You’re like, whoa.
Okay. Do you want to leave?
It’s pretty good, but a lot of things need to be improved. That’s for sure.
Same goes for the BBC.
He’s put you right next to me.
What are you doing, pointing camera at the sign or something?
No, Twitter is… I’d say we’re roughly breakeven at this point.
Yeah, sure. We’ll get a few people going here.
They’re fine. Dogs are great.
You weren’t expecting that.
You can’t name a single example?
Oh, people this .
I think it’s going to swim.
It’s not physically possible to speak to that many people.
No, it’s just realtime doxing is not allowed because-
Can I interview you?
So what do you want to do?
That was really dope.
Then how did you see the hateful content?
Well, I guess probably we can make that change tomorrow if you’d like.
What about him?
Then how did you know? You literally said-
