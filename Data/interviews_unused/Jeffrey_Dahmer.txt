Had contact with us. We were in Ohio. We'd visit.
And his opponents couldn't understand why they were laughing so much.
Shari -- Shari engendered that relationship.
And suddenly that -- somehow...
He just was a pickup.
... for liquor.
But he did dispose of their bodies, yes.
We sat just motionless and sick to our stomach.
And he wondered if he had had his penis cut off.
Well, we've promised to keep him completely secret with respect...
I met him at the Milwaukee County Jail. I went down to meet with him.
Yes. Yes. Except extremely shy.
In Cobb , Colorado.
We'd talk on the phone.
Torturing animals...
Disorderly conduct.
Necrophilia. Necrophilia.
Right. Right. You always hesitate to...
There weren't any books then. But since then...
That's definitely part of it.
Seven years' difference, so...
Seventeen, I think.
And if it will help.
... just Jeff.
He went to Ohio State.
He kept getting together with another young man.
When he was 18.
His back was to us most of the time.
Milwaukee. Except for the first one.
Jeff, I think -- he told me that it disturbed him very much.
We were encouraged.
The father's story.
No, she's deceased. Cancer.
Don't let him out. His attorney actually let him out four months...
Yes. KING: Did he like "Batman"?
Shy, that sort of thing.
Steven Hicks .
I -- I -- I...
No. No. I'm proud of the name Dahmer.
He let him out early. Earlier than what his sentence had been given.
And it went quite well for a while, but then things started to occur.
We watched "Popeye" together every morning -- Saturday morning.
I don't think so.
Not at first at all, no.
Analytical chemist and graduate student.
A Wisconsin correctional institution.
Very difficult, yes. She would spasm. Her jaw would go sideways.
It was an honor meeting you.
"Lionel, I forgive Jeff."
He kept it in. He did not express anger.
In all my conversations with Jeff, that was not a factor at all.
Not do well at all, no.
No. Not at all.
I wanted -- he wanted to be cremated.
No. Nothing except colic. It kept us awake a lot.
Yes, in Ohio. And getting into trouble.
No, he didn't.
We're sitting in the courtroom, just stunned, without any sleep.
No. And no parent, no peer, no anyone...
Thank you, Larry.
I loved him very deeply.
He came back home. And I then proceeded to take him to the Army...
In Milwaukee, and later at Iowa State University.
He was 18, and I had moved out of the house.
To all of his friends, really.
Portage, Wisconsin.
The court let him out.
From Iowa State University in Iowa.
They saw him as different from a Bundy or a Gacy.
For a short time.
I forgot the formal name of -- necrosis? Not necrosis.
Drinking and selling his blood.
Yes, he did change his name.
So he didn't -- he did not have a big self image.
She was at the service, and she said to me, "Lionel..."
A couple -- two or three years.
Just a -- he was a hitchhiker.
We can really find something, perhaps. But not a dead brain.
He forgot where he left the car many times.
Oh, yes. I mean, through his -- through advice of me and the attorney.
Dig. Just pull out everything that you possibly can. Don't stop.
No, just those two.
Regardless of warning, these people still went with it.
Yes. Yes. Jeff played on the tennis team.
No. No, he did not.
Sign up for the Army, right.
Double hernia.
