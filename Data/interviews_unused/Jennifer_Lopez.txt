You're not. And that hurt me.
No, I'm not mad at anybody.
You're no different.
I'm the champ - from "Raging Bull."
Oh. I didn't know we snapped on this show.
That's the thinking in the world.
Like, we all have that...
...Assistant manager for six.
But also painted...
You saw it. What is it about?
...And I don't hold them close, you know?
Fifteen years now.
Yeah, right, right.
It's a little bit like...
Rodriguez, A-Rod
I'm just trying to live my life...
Where do I need to improve? What's...
Many people...
I think so because that...
That's not my goal. That is not my goal.
Yeah. She does.
One of many that we'll have the next few days.
Honestly, to find something that you love to do.
I've learned that from Alex - right...
I'll help you. I'll help you.
...Do OK, like, be better every day.
What do you mean?
And she didn't have the education.
Yeah, so many.
You have to stand up for yourself.
Tons. And by the way, the interviewer...
They create our peace or our not peace.
The movie release?

It did two things.

Just working and working and working.
I'm used to go time.
Oh, she's helped the store.
Yeah, many times.
Like, that's my thing.
And you go, oh...
Yeah. But I'm a sensitive person, so anything...
That bothered me...
She was like, you have to keep singing.
Because a woman - yup.
...And painted...
You know, so that's always fun.
...That was for me, you know?
And she does that in every aspect of her life.
And we just became fast friends like immediately.
And usually thatâ€™ll set you on the right path.
Like a Costco.
Thank you, thank you so much.
Yes, she does.
You deserve to be here.
...Or whatever. And that's not fair...
It plays awesome, thank God. .
But you have to.
...You were right.
It's not as expected, right?
It was is great. It's great.
Yeah. The slapping in the face.
...Team - Alex, my boyfriend.
Over 40-something junkets. I don' know.
