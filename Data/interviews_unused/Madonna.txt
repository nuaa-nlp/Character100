Why did you have to go and read a top ten list?
You're a  damn liar!
Yes, I'm a second.
There's no music.
No, but he's a real natural.
Somebody fucked up.
"Speed the Plow."
I wouldn't go that far.
When you come back I'll still be here,  it!
And then I go I'm doing that. I'm doing that. That's not good.
I hope I haven't hurt your feelings.
There is definitely something wrong with me...
Life requires a lot of organization.
I'm trying not to be. I'm trying to think before I say and do.
And the question, and the answer is, um...
Yah I'm sitting on it.
Pretty good, I won't say I've never made...
Is it cause I've been saying ?
That's good. I like that.
I don't know, I just do.
You're twisted.
Relationships?
See, I haven't dated that many basketball players.
Everybody pees in the shower and everybody picks their nose.
I want that fish so sell it to me.
And don't be so touchy . Can't we just get along?
It's never a problem.
Yes, wow, so a lot's happened for both of us.
Was it planned? Was it...
You get it, right?
What's that all about?
It's been great. How many years was it?
People don't want to hear the word  in their...
Speaking of the NBA.
... tonight...I think we should ...
As opposed to what?
This seems all very rehearsed.
You used to be really kind of, like, cool.
What's the matter? Don't you want to dance with me?
Well, you should.
Like three years. So much has happened.
No, that's not what you want to know.
We're going to have to deal with each other.
Things like that.
Yes, I mean, don't all singers and...
I know. How freaky is that?
Want to get it?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's a tough one. I mean I think.
Not after that.
Aren't they fantastic?
No. Absolutely not.
yeah well I've never succumbed to peer pressure.
Speak the truth or train the devil baby.
That was a very subtle joke.
Both questions?
You know what? When my nannies have days off...
Well, we did a video together. I...
No, no, no. It's preferable to acting in film.
Isn't there anything you really want to ask me?
Don't treat me special, Ok?
I believe you have already.
Where is that thing?
He's a rabbi, yes.
And he's going to smell my underwear.
About you or life in general?
Yes, and then he's the bad guy.
Yes. Yes, that's another way to put it. Thanks Larry.
What are you doing?
Don't go away.
Is the show almost over?
Yes, I am. Life is good.
Yes, all for the better.
We'll you're not in the NBA, so forget about it.
No. We really liked each other. We enjoyed...
I don't think he understands the meaning of friendship.
Don't make me act a fool, Dave.
Aren't there any other segments? That's it?
During the crusades for instance. Yes. Yes.
I don't really, it's not funny  forget it.
That microphone is really long.
I see you've got your dancing shoes on.
Don't  with me Dave
I do in the beginning of next year.
Wait a minute, Aren't you going to smell them?
My ass looks a lot better than that.
Why am I here? What am I doing here? What is my purpose?
I was pretty understanding, actually.
I'll have you arrested.
I did. I did a play and I...
I don't think we should...
And that was fabulous. I loved it.
You mean that unsympathetic?
What happens whey you take it out?
Because you are always  with me on the show.
And mazel tov to you too.
Don't make me act a fool, Dave, alright.
We are living ahead of the time when it actually is.
People like to see you go up and they love to see you go down.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
It's not really this late anyway, this is all a fantasy.
All they're interested in is cars. Cars.
Salad. Simple, but tasty.
Because you just kiss up to everybody on your show now.
My favorite city is New York. Yes. Love it.
He showed me the gym.
I do. I love everything I do. I would never -- I don't know.
That is not true. Do I look like I've missed any meals?
Money's made you soft.
Ein sof means endlessness.
No they haven't seen, they haven't seen my unde.. mine ...
No, I didn't. I didn't. I had no idea.
Yes, totally. Yes.
It's my mother's name. I was named after my mother.
Yes. It's all...It's in the can.
Toys. Cars. Wheels.
... didn't get paid for that either.
It was -- yes. It's fun doing a villain.
Yes. That's where I really grew up.
Why's she doing a Davd Mammet Play...
You don't know a  damn thing.
Gosh, two years after that?
It hurt, the answer is yes, both questions.
Who said that?
I was in Los Angeles. I was on tour.
Don't make me, do you want to touch my dress?
No holds, barred.
Look I don't want to ...
No. They don't watch TV.
It's just the right size.
Major chemistry, yes, absolutely.
Really? In what way?
That's not where they go.
You really have, you really...
Ein sof. What do you think of that?
To not have to worry about...
Untrue rumor, I mean that's like funny David Letterman.
That's what you want to know?
Oh, oh, oh, and pee in the shower.
I gave them to you for a reason.
As you would have them do unto you.
He's not tall enough.
I don't know. London, New York and Los Angeles.
Yes, sure. It appealed to my ego.
Detroit. Pontiac. Rochester.
It is the mystical interpretation of the Torah, yes.
Anyways, what, oooh...
Why do we have to be, why do you keep flashing that card?
Are you talkin' to me?
Love at first sight?
I had to hug him. I kind of kissed him.
You'll be right back with my husband.
Mechanics. How things work. You know what I mean?
Sell me that fish.
Well, I mean, you are selling your own image, right, when...
Living vicariously through everybody, you know.
I still ask the price.
It was pretty small.
What do you think?
Dancing's my first love.
I don't know why I get so much .
I don't think we should ever cut to a commercial.
My first, first, first love. Yes. And then I would be singing.
And I think I did something like that.
How about i'n sof?
No let's just get back to you.
I wouldn't want you to do that.
You are not irritating me.
Are you trying to?
I thought you were going to ask me if I had a girlfriend. Um.
Yes. I am. I have, yes.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I mean, it's just in their molecular structure.
Actually you do irritate me sometimes.
Did you know that it's good if you pee in the shower?
Yes. KING: Got a new album coming?
No, that's where, that's where you keep my panties.
Yeah, you just, Dave just slobbered all over my cigar.
... I'm sitting here.
They're not real. They don't last.
Isn't that sort of like jumbo shrimp?
Let's keep talking and film every second of it.
I like the way you say my name, by the way.
You go from start to finish...
There seems to be a lot of confusion right now.
No, they sure don't.
And I'm trying to work against that so...
No, no, no, no, no.
Well, now Larry I wasn't really making love to him.
Can't this just go on and on?
Isn't that an oxymoron? An untrue rumor.
Go, go! Oh, yeah!
Oh, forgive me for being in a rush to get back to civilization.
What part of your body?
Have you ever smoked Endo?
And then it would be writing. And then it would be acting.
Don't tell me you haven't peed in the shower.
James Bond needs to get -- needs to get techno so...
Wait a minute, I just want to ask you one more question.
Sure. Absolutely.
Incidentally, you are a sick .
I know, but I do anyway.
Why are you so obsessed with my sex life?
I want to know, what do people...
And I have a great assistant.
We only have a few minutes.
I always go there, and really I don't care, I mean.
Absolutely. And we're good friends. And he's a great person.
Why? So you can forget about me? No chance, sailor.
Don't fuck with me Dave?
Totally. Totally. It's our nature.
I did for "Speed the Plow."
Can't we just break the rules?
This is the closest I'm ever going to get to kissing you.
And then there's the metaphysical reason behind it.
The crowds, you mean.
We don't sleep very much.
Very important, yes.
Did you ask him about the gym?
Yes. It's just in my gut. Yes.
I don't think, I think we should break the rules...
OK? Knock that stuff off.
The Old Testament. But you know what? Jesus was a cabalist.
You are always  with me on the show.
Don't make me act a fool.
I wanted to share something that I knew with you.
