I do remember it. And I remember being in your spot. When I come through the first time.
That was nerve-racking. Like you said, when I hit — so many variables there. One, the bike.
You were rocked up. You don’t have to be so modest, brother, it’s your show.
It was cool. The look and everything was really cool. It just took me a while to put it together.
Did you ever go to the China Club in New York?
It will be fine. I’m like Paul, come on. I said i’ve got to get these fixed.
And then it breaks down everything that you do. There’s no continuity. There’s no fluidity.
So I come to and I look you know. And I hear all this and I see Kurt on Vince, right.
I was mesmerized right away by it.
Every time I go out, i’m going out one time. I went out and, you know, I had that match in Saudi.
They had this gigantic egg on the set. Yeah, you got it. There it is.
Not for long because after the adrenaline wears off, then the pain comes back.
So they were going at it. It was a charter plane. So they had all the big first class seats.
So I started looking outside of the box in how to put all this together and become this character.
We know that. You’ve got to remove yourself a little bit and look at the big picture of this thing.
I’ve got to do what i’ve got to do at this point. That’s why, it was that way. I tried.
You were kicking it, man.
Tell me that. How do two red necks from Texas end up in a studio? That’s got me a little baffled.
We had been together a few months now. I’m following his lead. I’m still a green horn.
I’m proud. I feel very blessed honestly to have the career. I was fortunate.
That wasn’t called. That happened. That’s organic right there.
Now, I had been off almost a year at that point.
It allowed me to work a little differently which I think I needed to. Just because of our audience.
There were all kinds of Harley’s.
I felt it. It was quiet in a good way. Not being quiet because you’re stinking the joint out.
Oh, yeah. I walked back. I went through gorilla and I sat down.
I wasn’t there.
What do you have to apologize for?
It was another hit to my pride. Okay. I became kind of difficult at that point.
Vince is out of the equation, we’re talking about one of the boys.
He come on out, you’d get down, amateur position and stretch you and cross face you and everything.
Exactly and I felt that. I had been around long enough to know there was something special.
It was something that happen. I don’t blame Brock for me getting concussed.
Unfortunately, yeah.
I mean that all happened shortly after this picture was taken.
Yeah that’s a pretty fair statement. I think so. You definitely kind of did your own thing.
I don’t much, but when I do, I do. That’s perfect, man.
It’s about Ali and Frazier. Man this is when we were kings. I mean this was good times.
I’m just like, please don’t call.
Whatever it’s going to take, right.
So they leave. I call her over. Babe, come here, come here.
And the same way, I lived my gimmick. I lived it for years and years.
How you doing, brother? It’s been a minute.
Hey, if that’s the worst thing that happened to me over my career, i’d be all right, man.
But I realized that it’s not going to work if the work doesn’t match the character.
It was my time. But they weren’t happy about it, no.
That’s all right. I didn’t mind. Wanted to cash them checks, brother.
I gave them good homes. Cause I didn’t have anything at this time, you know.
Why don’t see you see if you guys can do something with him?
But, man, you know, I know you’re the same way. Pride is a sum bitch. It doesn’t matter.
It’s all speculation.
Ain’t no taking it back from this point.
At this moment, i’m not coming back.
There’s one guy. Guess him? One guy.
I’m thinking all right, here we go. I don’t know. Got one on the line.
Absolutely, man. I don’t do this often. You know that.
And it did. I knew Vince is too smart. It just took — it all worked out for the right reasons.
Oh, yeah. It’s all on the line right here. I have rolled the dice.
And that’s just the nature of the beast, you know. That’s how it is.
And everybody there is like that. So when I initially did it, nobody here sold. You sold it.
Like I froze. I was like whoa. And about that time he come up, man.
We were grinding, man.
That was the look, right?
I never felt that with him.
Well I didn’t appreciate that  one bit.
I had convinced myself to the point where like my stomach hurt that i’m going to be egg man.
And I’ve got no clue.
I know what’s coming afterwards.
I’m sitting on the desk. I’m looking around and there’s only like two people left that are upright.
And i’ll be damned, I feel pretty decent for the shape i’m in, I guess.
It’s a 40,000 seat stadium. Before I get to what you did to me, do you remember the headlock chain?
It was so bad.
He didn’t say that. So I called Dutch. I think Dutch might have been staying at my apartment there.
So, you know, I go to the house. Here’s a good story, too. So I didn’t know.
At that point right there is about as real as it gets.
I can’t imagine that going over real good either.
Egg man. And it all comes full circle. And you know your time is coming.
Yea, it was bad.
I run with my crew. And business was always there. Business was always fun.
I don’t know that i’m coming back next year.
Jake The Snake Roberts.
Boom, finishes. Come on. So we go back up.
And I knew at that point like, okay, i’m done here.
Same thing here.
Yeah, all four of those. Enjoyed it for the minute. I don’t know.
He stuck his head under the original guy in the original headlock. That’s right.
So it ended up being close to eight or nine months that I was off tv.
No, that’s not correct.
And you weren’t some scrub. You had a look about you. So, I knew, I can still get over, you know.
I’m like wow. I mean did I just hear that? And it was Ole.
But I knew this was what I wanted to do.
That’s all I got, right. So we have our match. We do our thing.
And that was halfway through that. They kept sending guys. Something happened — I don’t remember.
I don’t even remember this night. I mean I have watched it back now. I obviously know.
Yeah, absolutely. But I took the dogs. I’m like i’m getting something out of this, right?
Somebody just smarted off a little. You don’t know me. I’ve got no ill will.
Yeah, you can’t work with fear, not in this business.
So here we go. And drank all the whiskey. So we close the bar down.
We wanted to be more reality based.
I feel it. It’s still there. That was just for the business there.
And i’m freaking out now. He’s like don’t worry about it. I’ll get one these girls to sew them up.
But we had Amsterdam and Berlin and these places coming up. I wanted to be fresh and ready to go.
Well, it shouldn’t because, look, I mean things happen. It’s not ballet. Things happen in the ring.
But it was a struggle.
You respect it because it’s hard — it’s hard in this business and this atmosphere.
See, that gives you the out right there.
