I mean I'm not gonna be able to spend this money.
My favorite ring? I've always said the next one. The next one's the best.
So there’s a lot of competitiveness.
Yeah, that's right.
There's been some crazy stuff. Yes. Yeah.
No. You don't. You don't hear the crowd.
That'd be a tough place to make it.
What do I make of it?
If I could ever play softball, I'd kick their butts.
I eat pretty good.
Guys have worked hard at it and it's been a lot of fun.
So I really enjoyed that part.
Probably in Scotland playing golf with my mom and dad. Yeah.
That was a great story.
So we’re going to get some time today to all chill out and enjoy it.
Yeah. Twelve. Gunslinger.
And if I don't do that, then we won't win. And that's not fun.
We had weigh-in today and I'm right where coach wants me.
I’ll get to the point right away. I’m retiring for good.
'Cause if they were to evaluate it the way I did, it'd be an easy decision.
Yeah. I hear that quite a bit.
I think I get more out of that than anything.
I look to the receiver. I pump him. He jumps.
So the guys put the work in and we all went out and we got it done.
It's been a lot.
Let other people say it. It sounds so much better.
I know where I'm throwing. And now I'm trying to pump it. So I drop back.
I come off the fake. I look up at him. He looks at me.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
They try. They try. And I try to look out for them just the same.
Next question.
But, yeah, it's something I like, and something I'm always staying on top of.
Yeah. I would say so. Self-deprecating.
At some point, oh yeah. I mean I look forward to that very much.
But that's one of the best environments for football you could ever have.
I mean, that speaks for itself. I mean, it just shuts a lot of people up.
They're special.
You know? You got a goal. You got something you're trying to accomplish.
The third one?
If, see you, you can't ask that --
I didn't think people wanted that.
They played their ass off.
Whether I do it or not, I don't know. Who does?
We've got a lot of work left before we're ready for that.
