Cyrus dated rapper Lil Xan from June to September 2018. Cyrus is known to be vocal about her mental health challenges. She experiences depression and anxiety, with panic attacks as part of the latter. She has stated she goes to therapy to address these challenges. Her music often relates to her struggles, such as in her EP Good Cry with "Sadness" and "Topanga" and somber songs such as in her EP The End of Everything with "July" and "Lonely".
In December 2020, Cyrus spoke out in support of the former One Direction member Harry Styles wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue after he had been criticized by conservative commentator Candace Owens. However, in doing this she called Owens a "nappy ass heaux," which briefly prompted backlash and scrutiny against Cyrus for using a racist term referring to Afro-centric hair texture. She subsequently issued an apology for using the term by stating, "I am mortified that I used a term without knowing the context and history, but I know now and I am horrified and truly sorry. I will never use it again. Thank you for educating me. I in no way meant to offend anyone. I am so so sorry."
In 2013, Cyrus used her 13th birthday as an opportunity to raise funds to ban the use of horse-drawn carriages in New York City. More recently, she has worked with PETA, first appearing in an ad protesting the use of animal dissection in high school science classes instead of plastic models or virtual dissection programs then in another supporting a SeaWorld boycott.
In 2019, after the release of her single "Lonely", Noah teamed up with the Crystal Campaign and released a merchandising collection called The Lonely Collection in which funds were collected to benefit The Jed Foundation, a non-profit organization in the United States that exists to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for American teens and young adults. Later, Cyrus sold some of her old clothes on the Depop app, donating the proceeds to The Jed Foundation.
