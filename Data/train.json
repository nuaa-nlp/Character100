On 13 April 1992 , Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie . The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds ; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton .

Henry himself , at least in the early part of his reign , was a devout and well - informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ( \" Defence of the Seven Sacraments \" ) earned him the title of Fidei Defensor ( Defender of the Faith ) from Pope Leo X . The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy , albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms . It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage . Certainly , by 1527 , he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was \" blighted in the eyes of God \" . Indeed , in marrying Catherine , his brother ' s wife , he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20 : 21 , a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null . [ nb 2 ] Martin Luther , on the other hand , had initially argued against the annulment , stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce . Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment . It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled , forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack . In going public , all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost . Henry sent his secretary , William Knight , to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull . Knight was unsuccessful ; the Pope could not be misled so easily . Now you need to answer the question \"When did you believe that your marriage to Catherine was \"blighted in the eyes of God\"?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",

Writing for The Guardian , Peter Conrad suggested that it was Diana who let the journalists and paparazzi into her life as she knew they were the source of her power ; thus , she \" overburdened herself with public duties \" and destroyed the border between private and public life . This view was supported by Christopher Hitchens , who believed that \" in pursuit of a personal solution to an unhappy private life , she became an assiduous leaker to the press \" . Tina Brown argued that Diana was in no way \" a vulnerable victim of media manipulation \" , and she found it \" offensive to present the canny , resourceful Diana as a woman of no agency , as either a foolish , duped child or the hapless casualty of malevolent muckrakers \" . Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman , who later hacked the phones of Diana ' s sons on several occasions , stated in a court in 2014 that in 1992 Diana sent a confidential directory which contained numbers of senior members of the royal household to their office to get back at her then husband .

On Butterfly , Carey collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff , such as Sean Combs , Q - Tip , Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters . In mid - 1997 , after four years of marriage , Carey and Mottola separated . Carey described Mottola as increasingly controlling , and viewed her newfound independence as a new lease on life .

Butterfly introduced a more subdued style of singing , with critics noting Carey ' s incorporation of breathy vocals . Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity , while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess . The music video for the album ' s lead single , \" Honey \" , her first since separating from Mottola , introduced a more overtly sexual image . Butterfly became Carey ' s best - reviewed album , with attention placed on the album ' s exploration of more mature lyrical themes . In their review of the album , Rolling Stone wrote \" [ It ' s ] not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine , Houston - style balladry ... but the predominant mood of ' Butterfly ' is one of coolly erotic reverie . \" AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey ' s vocals as \" sultrier and more controlled than ever , \" and felt the album \" illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music , which makes her a rarity among her ' 90s peers . ' \" \" Honey \" and \" My All \" , the album ' s fifth single , both topped the Hot 100 , making Carey a female artist with the most number - one singles in the chart ' s history .

General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission . With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , the bombing campaign ended on June 10 , 1999 .

In the following years , this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits , managers , former and current players , and by the end of Bar \u00e7 a ' s second treble - winning season , Messi ' s superiority , ahead of Maradona and Pel \u00e9 , had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe . He initially received several dismissals by critics , based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina , until he won his first at the 2021 Copa Am \u00e9 rica . Now you need to answer the question \"At what age did you establish yourself as one of the world's best players?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",

The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy , albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms . It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage . Certainly , by 1527 , he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was \" blighted in the eyes of God \" . Indeed , in marrying Catherine , his brother ' s wife , he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20 : 21 , a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null . [ nb 2 ] Martin Luther , on the other hand , had initially argued against the annulment , stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce . Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment . It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled , forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack . In going public , all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost . Henry sent his secretary , William Knight , to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull . Knight was unsuccessful ; the Pope could not be misled so easily .

S . Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 , named Operation Allied Force . The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the ethnic cleansing ( and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide ) of Albanians by Yugoslav anti - guerilla military units . General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission . With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , the bombing campaign ended on June 10 , 1999 . The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region . NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat , though two died in an Apache helicopter crash . Journalists in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as false and greatly exaggerated . Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24 , 1999 , estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had been approximately 1 , 800 , with critics asserting that little or no evidence existed of genocide . In a post - war inquiry , the Organization for Security and Co - operation in Europe noted \" the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings , killings , rape , kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24 . \" In 2001 , the UN - supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide ( the intent to destroy a people ) did not take place , but recognized \" a systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe maltreatments \" with the intention being the forceful departure of the Albanian population . The term \" ethnic cleansing \" was used as an alternative to \" genocide \" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement , though critics charge there is little difference . Slobodan Milo \u0161 evi \u0107 , the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities , was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the war .

After Pope Julius II created the anti - French Holy League in October 1511 , Henry followed Ferdinand ' s lead and brought England into the new League . An initial joint Anglo - Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England , the start of making Henry ' s dreams of ruling France a reality . The attack , however , following a formal declaration of war in April 1512 , was not led by Henry personally and was a considerable failure ; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends , and it strained the Anglo - Spanish alliance . Nevertheless , the French were pushed out of Italy soon after , and the alliance survived , with both parties keen to win further victories over the French .

DiCaprio earned his seventh Golden Globes nomination for the film . Revolutionary Road grossed $ 75.9 \u00a0 million against its budget of $ 35 \u00a0 million .

And if The Undertaker were to win the match , he would be rewarded the opportunity to assault Bearer however he pleased . Even though The Undertaker won this match , interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape Undertaker ' s clutches . It was also at this event that The Undertaker had developed a comparatively more humanized and more informal yet still superhuman \" Deadman \" incarnation . In this then new form , he took on a Goth appearance and persona , with a brash , rebelling , Championship - driven mean streak ( perhaps to better fit in with the then - budding , more adult - oriented Attitude Era ) . This delivering , dubbed \" The Lord of Darkness \" , was the 3rd incarnation of his Deadman persona . Following Survivor Series , The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner , who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival . At In Your House 12 : It ' s Time , The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match even with Mankind heavily involved throughout the entire encounter . The Undertaker then moved on to feud with Vader , whom he faced in January 1997 at the Royal Rumble in a singles match , which The Undertaker lost after Bearer interfered on behalf of his new prot \u00e9 g \u00e9 . The two then clashed in the Royal Rumble match itself as they made it to the final moments of the match , but both were eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin , who had crept back into the match after his elimination was unseen . He faced both Vader and Austin in a four - corners elimination match for the vacant WWF Championship at In Your House 13 : Final Four , but Bret Hart won . However , the following month , The Undertaker managed to win the WWF Championship for the second time by defeating Sycho Sid at WrestleMania 13 . Reviving his first Deadman incarnation for that night only , The Undertaker appeared as the \" Old West Mortician \" , donning the trademarked gray wrestling gear accessories ( boot spats , tie , gloves ) , along with a pitch - black entrance with only a white spotlight shined over him , contrasted from the purple / blue semidarkness associated with the rest of his Deadman incarnations .

In the last phase of his career , Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects . These included run - on lines , irregular pauses and stops , and extreme variations in sentence structure and length . In Macbeth , for example , the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another : \" was the hope drunk / Wherein you dressed yourself ? \" ( 1.7 . 35 \u2013 38 ) ; \" ... \u00a0 pity , like a naked new - born babe / Striding the blast , or heaven ' s cherubim , hors ' d / Upon the sightless couriers of the air \u00a0 ... \" ( 1.7 . 21 \u2013 25 ) .

A Midsummer Night ' s Dream is a witty mixture of romance , fairy magic , and comic lowlife scenes . Shakespeare ' s next comedy , the equally romantic Merchant of Venice , contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock , which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences . The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing , the charming rural setting of As You Like It , and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare ' s sequence of great comedies . After the lyrical Richard II , written almost entirely in verse , Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s , Henry IV , parts 1 and 2 , and Henry V . His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes , prose and poetry , and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work . This period begins and ends with two tragedies : Romeo and Juliet , the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence , love , and death ; and Julius Caesar \u2014 based on Sir Thomas North ' s 1579 translation of Plutarch ' s Parallel Lives \u2014 which introduced a new kind of drama .

At the same time , according to Brennan , at the beginning of her third trimester , Jobs said to her : \" I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion . I just didn ' t want to do that . \" [ citation needed ] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her . Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple . She stated that Jobs told her \" If you give up this baby for adoption , you will be sorry \" and \" I am never going to help you \" . [ citation needed ] According to Brennan , Jobs \" started to seed people with the notion that I slept around , and he was infertile , which meant that this could not be his child \" . A few weeks before she was due to give birth , Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm . She accepted the offer . [ citation needed ] When Jobs was 23 ( the same age as his biological parents when they had him ) Brennan gave birth to her baby , Lisa Brennan , on May 17 , 1978 . Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland , their mutual friend and the farm owner . While distant , Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby , which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket . Brennan suggested the name \" Lisa \" which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name \" Lisa \" while he \" was also publicly denying paternity \" . She would discover later that during this time , Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name ( his first choice was \" Claire \" after St . Clare ) . She stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby ' s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her . Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase , \" Local Integrated Software Architecture \" as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa . Decades later , however , Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that \" obviously , it was named for my daughter \" .

The Undertaker ' s next rivalry initiated at Survivor Series with Yokozuna when a clash between the two lost control , causing them to be counted out in an elimination tag match . In the weeks following , The Undertaker and Bearer spooked Yokozuna with multiple segments from their wintery and remote rural area workshop . There , Bearer presented The Undertaker hard at work carpentering Yokozuna what would eventually become a \" double wide , double deep casket \" custom - built for Yokozuna ' s immensely overweight size . The feud culminated in a WWF Championship casket match at the Royal Rumble in January 1994 . During the match , Yokozuna sealed The Undertaker in the casket with the assistance of a multitude of heel wrestlers ( some of them Whippleman - managed ) hired by Yokozuna ' s vindictive managers Jim Cornette and Mr . Fuji , which was in retaliation for Bearer ' s casket match stipulation that he snuck into their Royal Rumble match contract . After being trapped inside the casket by the pack , green vapor emitted from the casket and the arena lights went out . Undertaker then appeared from inside the casket on the video screen , representing the spirit of his dead corpse , warning that he would produce a future \" rebirth \" of himself , explaining to his antagonists that he cannot and will not Rest in Peace . The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for seven months after his loss to Yokozuna . In reality , he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal .

Jenkins says that Churchill ' s self - belief was \" far stronger than any class or tribal loyalty \" . Whether Churchill was a conservative or a liberal , he was nearly always opposed to socialism because of its propensity for state planning and his belief in free markets . The exception was during his wartime coalition when he was completely reliant upon the support of his Labour colleagues . Although the Labour leaders were willing to join his coalition , Churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class . His response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and his anti - socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists . They saw him as a reactionary who represented imperialism , militarism , and the interests of the upper classes in the class war .

Many critics believe that Shakespeare ' s greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art . The titular hero of one of Shakespeare ' s greatest tragedies , Hamlet , has probably been discussed more than any other Shakespearean character , especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \" To be or not to be ; that is the question \" . Unlike the introverted Hamlet , whose fatal flaw is hesitation , the heroes of the tragedies that followed , Othello and King Lear , are undone by hasty errors of judgement . The plots of Shakespeare ' s tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws , which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves . In Othello , the villain Iago stokes Othello ' s sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him . In King Lear , the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers , initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear ' s youngest daughter Cordelia . According to the critic Frank Kermode , \" the play ... offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty \" . In Macbeth , the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare ' s tragedies , uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife , Lady Macbeth , to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn . In this play , Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure . His last major tragedies , Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus , contain some of Shakespeare ' s finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T . S . Eliot .

The flagship program was the Back on Track initiative , a first - of - its - kind reentry program for first - time nonviolent offenders aged 18 \u2013 30 . Initiative participants whose crimes were not weapon - or gang - related would plead guilty in exchange for a deferral of sentencing and regular appearances before a judge over a twelve - to eighteen - month period . The program maintained rigorous graduation requirements , mandating completion of up to 220 hours of community service , obtaining a high - school - equivalency diploma , maintaining steady employment , taking parenting classes , and passing drug tests . At graduation , the court would dismiss the case and expunge the graduate ' s record . Over six years , the 200 people graduated from the program had a recidivism rate of less than ten percent , compared to the 53 percent of California ' s drug offenders who returned to prison within two years of release . Back on Track earned recognition from the U . S . Department of Justice as a model for reentry programs . The DOJ found that the cost to the taxpayers per participant was markedly lower ( $ 5 , 000 ) than the cost of adjudicating a case ( $ 10 , 000 ) and housing a low - level offender ( $ 50 , 000 ) . In 2009 , a state law ( the Back on Track Reentry Act , A . B . 750 ) was enacted , encouraging other California counties to start similar programs .

The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy , albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms . It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage . Certainly , by 1527 , he had convinced himself that Catherine had produced no male heir because their union was \" blighted in the eyes of God \" . Indeed , in marrying Catherine , his brother ' s wife , he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20 : 21 , a justification Thomas Cranmer used to declare the marriage null . [ nb 2 ] Martin Luther , on the other hand , had initially argued against the annulment , stating that Henry VIII could take a second wife in accordance with his teaching that the Bible allowed for polygamy but not divorce . Henry now believed the Pope had lacked the authority to grant a dispensation from this impediment . It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled , forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack . In going public , all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost . Henry sent his secretary , William Knight , to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull . Knight was unsuccessful ; the Pope could not be misled so easily .

S . Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 , named Operation Allied Force . The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the ethnic cleansing ( and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide ) of Albanians by Yugoslav anti - guerilla military units . General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission . With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , the bombing campaign ended on June 10 , 1999 . The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region . NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat , though two died in an Apache helicopter crash . Journalists in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as false and greatly exaggerated . Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24 , 1999 , estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had been approximately 1 , 800 , with critics asserting that little or no evidence existed of genocide . In a post - war inquiry , the Organization for Security and Co - operation in Europe noted \" the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings , killings , rape , kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24 . \" In 2001 , the UN - supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide ( the intent to destroy a people ) did not take place , but recognized \" a systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe maltreatments \" with the intention being the forceful departure of the Albanian population . The term \" ethnic cleansing \" was used as an alternative to \" genocide \" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement , though critics charge there is little difference . Slobodan Milo \u0161 evi \u0107 , the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities , was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the war .

Pop vocalists usually sing songs ' straight ' , but Madonna employs subtext , irony , aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did . \" Madonna used a bright , girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became pass \u00e9 in her later works . The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labeled her as \" Minnie Mouse on helium \" . During the filming of Evita ( 1996 ) , Madonna had to take vocal lessons , which increased her range further . Of this experience she commented , \" I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn ' t using . Before , I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it . \" Now you need to answer the question \"What is your vocal range?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",

He also won passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President , making it \" the nerve center of the federal administrative system . \" When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid - 1937 , during the onset of the recession of 1937 \u2013 1938 , Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States , alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy ( of which they found none ) . He then asked Congress for $ 5 \u00a0 billion ( equivalent to $ 94.25 \u00a0 billion in 2021 ) in relief and public works funding . This managed to eventually create as many as 3.3 \u00a0 million WPA jobs by 1938 . Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks , bridges , and other infrastructure across the country , and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations \u2014 investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources . Beyond this , however , Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act , administrative reorganization , and regional planning measures , all of which were leftovers from a regular session . According to Burns , this attempt illustrated Roosevelt ' s inability to settle on a basic economic program . Now you need to answer the question \"What were the key provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",
        "output": "The Fair Labor Standards Act outlawed child labor, established a federal minimum wage, and required overtime pay for certain employees who work more than forty hours per week."

In response , Undertaker cut promos of ominous warning against Styles in which for the first time in years , he broke from the Deadman gimmick by presenting as himself out of character .

They argued that no action taken on the first particle could instantaneously affect the other , since this would involve information being transmitted faster than light , which is forbidden by the theory of relativity . They invoked a principle , later known as the \" EPR criterion of reality \" , positing that : \" If , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i . e . , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity . \" From this , they inferred that the second particle must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured . But quantum mechanics considers these two observables incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both to any system . Einstein , Podolsky , and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality . Now you need to answer the question \"What was the principle invoked by you, Podolsky, and Rosen known as?\", and as the person you need to role-play, your answer is:",
        "output": "The principle was later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\"."
